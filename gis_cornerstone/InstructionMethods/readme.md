# Best Practices for Writing & Speaking Instruction
This course will utilize the resources of the [TAMU University Writing Center](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Faculty/Planning-Designing-W-C-Courses/Best-Practices) to provide speaking instruction to enrolled students. In particular, the following strategies will be utilized (Adapted from ["Best Practices for W&C Courses"](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu/Faculty/Planning-Designing-W-C-Courses/Best-Practices)):

1. Show the value good communication. Students will be reminded from time to time that the instructor is willing to spend time on communication skills because they are important to their professional development. As students read course material or listen to oral performances, the instructor will comment on the quality of the writing or speaking, and encourage them to develop their own abilities.

2. Demonstrate what is meant by good writing and speaking. The instuctor will review the basics of good writing and speaking, as she/he understands them, in order to demonstrate that not everyone has the same standards for good writing or speaking and to demonstrate that many conventions change with the audience, type, and purpose of a document. The instructor will make clear her/his bottom-line issues, what her/his pet peeves might be (for example, sentences that end in prepositions), and how these expectations affect her/his evaluation of student writing. Pet peeves and expectations, that every essay needs a thesis statement or every paragraph needs a topic sentence for example, will be explained explicitly. 

3. Remind students that good writing and speaking vary with the rhetorical situation. There is no universal, unchanging formula for good communication. Even the "rules" of grammar and punctuation can be flexible and are best thought of as conventions. The best communicators develop an understanding of the constraints under which they work in each situation and accommodate their style to those constraints. To enforce this point, the instructor will create assignments that require stduents to adjust to different situations. As assignments are introduced, the instructor will spend a few moments discussing audience expectations, the constraints and expectations of the document type, and other matters that can affect the finished product.

4. Demystify the composing process. The instuctor will use every opportunity to demystify the composing process and show that writing and speaking are skills that can be learned through effort and practice. The instructor will look to her/his own advice and experience as a writer and speaker to provide examples of how a real communicator in the real world manages this complex and challenging task. Where, when, or how has the instructor struggled with writing? Does the instructor get nervous before a presentation? Does the instructor have peers review her/his most important work? Does the instructor solicit editing advice? 

5. Provide many and varied opportunities for practice. Students will be asked to present information to themselves and peers several times in order to reinforce concepts, organize thoughts, encourage critical thinking, and develop fluency.

6. All graded work will begin with a written prompt that includes the evaluation criteria.

7. Provide ample formative feedback in many different forms. Feedback will be provided during the composing process on drafts and/or outlines, and as a final evaluation on finished works. A grading rubric will be used during the composing and prewriting stages so that students can assess their own and their peers' efforts. When students are working on a similar assignment, the instructor will randomly read and publicly assess samples, and/or models from previous classes. All students, even those who feel confident, will be encouraged to use the services of consultants at the University Writing Center.

8. Make sure assistance is available. Students will know that if they are blocked or confused, help is available. Students will also know that even the best writers and presenters receive feedback from others to guide revision.
