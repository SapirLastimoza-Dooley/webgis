# TAMU Geospatial Cornerstone: Course Options 

# Summary 
This course is offered in four different flavors ranging from not-flipped (a traditional in-person, lecture-style class) to totally-flipped (all teaching materials delivered online, all coursework completed online). 

Students may choose to participate in any of these four options based on their scheduled preference, the learning preference, or any other preference. All students in all sections will complete the same required work for this course. 

The only difference between the four options is the mode of content delivery, and the in-class activities. 

Students may switch back and forth between options at any time as they wish.

# Purpose
The purpose of the “Measuring Student Experiences Along the Flipped-Class Spectrum in an Undergraduate Discipline Introduction and Professionalization Class” project is to: (1) build a categorical structure capable of classifying an overall course, its delivery mechanisms, its activities, and its assessments for residential, distance, and hybrid course along a “flipped-course spectrum”, ranging from fully residential (i.e., a traditional class) to fully online (i.e., fully-flipped); (2) apply the flipped-class spectrum categorization approach to classify an undergraduate TAMU introduction to a discipline and professionalization course; (3) objectively and subjectively assess the experiences and opinions of participants who elected to participate in specific stages of the flipped-class spectrum; and (4) subjectively and objectively evaluate the quality of work produced by student participants to draw inferences between participation in a flipped-class spectrum stage and learner outcomes.

# Course Description
The Texas A&M University (TAMU) Geography Department (GEOG) GEOG 215 Geospatial Cornerstone course is a 200-level course appropriate for sophomore majors in the TAMU Geography Department pursuing four-year Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees in Geography,  Geographic Information Science & Technology (GIST), or University Studies, the three degree majors offered by the Department. GEOG 215 is a one-credit course which fulfills a portion of the “Communication” curriculum requirements which all TAMU undergraduate students are subject to. The course was first offered in Fall of 2018 and enrolls three sections of 15 students each. The course meets on the TAMU Monday, Wednesday, Friday (MWF) sequence for 50 minutes on each of the days over the course of the 14.5 week semester. Each section only meets once per week, meaning that each student only attends a single M, W, or F section, depending on their registered section. 

According to the TAMU Course Catalog, the GEOG 215 Geospatial Cornerstone course is described as follows:

## GEOG 215 Geospatial Cornerstone
>Credit 1. 1 Lecture Hour.
>Professional career options, methods, strategies and skills involved in successful career planning in the geospatial sciences; highlights high impact learning opportunities such as study abroad and internships and the development of scientific communication skills. 

The course description published about the course within its syllabus includes the following learning outcomes and course objectives:

## Learning Outcomes or Course Objectives
This course is designed to introduce students to career opportunities that are available across the geospatial industry including both the public and private sectors. The course will include an introduction to various means by which students can be best-prepared for obtaining professional employment in the geospatial industry and for ensuring a successful career, including the types of skills that required in different segments of the industry and how and where students can find instruction and practical experience to obtain them. This course will highlight how and why high impact learning experiences such as undergraduate research, internships, and study abroad are important components of a student’s portfolio that will aide them in gaining professional employment before and following graduation. This course will provide training on effective writing and communication, and emphasize the importance of both as key aspects of successful careers in the geospatial industry.

At the end of this class, each student will be able to:

1. Enumerate and compare the types of jobs that are available in the geospatial industry, in both the public and private sectors;
2. Enumerate and evaluate the sets of geospatial skills required by different types of jobs, and develop an academic and extra-curricular plan to achieve those that are required for the types of professional employment that they desire;
3. Describe the application process for graduate and professional school, and develop a plan for improving the competitiveness of their application;
4. Develop an effective career plan including a reflection on the impact that internships and other high impact learning experiences may have on their job-seeking potential;
5. Prepare, present, and discuss the strengths of different resume styles and contents; and
6. Develop effective communication skills for geospatial information and topics in writing, visually, and in spoken presentations.


# Course Topics, Activities, Assessments, and Delivery Modes
The GEOG 215 course includes a traditional lecture component where students are formally exposed to materials, a set of individual activities where students are required to complete an activity related to the lecture materials on their own, and a set pair and team based activities where pairs or groups of students are required to complete an activity in a group setting.

The GEOG 215 course includes the following lecture topics, each covered as an independent lecture: (1) Introduction to the Class; (2) The Geospatial Industry; (3) Types of Geospatial Jobs; (4) Public vs. Private Employment; (5) The Job Getting Process; (6) Writing Resumes/Cover Letters; (7) Internships, Research, and other High Impact Learning Experiences (HILEs); (8) Graduate School; (9) Career Planning; (10) Effective Professional & Scientific Writing; (11) Professional Networking; (12) Effective Public Speaking; (13) Effectiveness in a Team; and (14) Project Management.

As a TAMU-recognized “Communication” course used in student degree plans to partially fulfill a student’s TAMU general education requirements, the GEOG 215 course includes several activities designed to afford students the opportunity to communicate in both writing and speaking settings, as well as receive both formative and summative feedback from peers and the instructor to help guide a student’s communication learning process. All course activities are graded as assessments using predefined rubricks which the students have access to in advance. The proportion of a student’s semester grade derived from the writing and speaking components of the class are summarized across both the individual and group assessments in the following table. The number of words written and minutes spoken in class conform to the “Communication” course requirements, set by TAMU policies for such courses.

Each of the course writing and speaking assignments, both for individual and group assignments, are discussed and explained by the instructor in advance of the students’ completion, with some of the activities taking place in-class and others taking place outside of class. In particular, the individual speaking assignments are typically completed by students outside of the class setting as self-recordings of the student discussing the assignment topic, recorded via the student’s phone or webcam. These recordings are then posted to the video sharing site YouTube. These videos are then reviewed, assessed, and graded by the instructor who provides formative and summative feedback to the student. In some instances, a student’s peers are also asked to provide feedback. In contrast, the pair and group activities typically take place within the in-class setting with students working one-on-one or in larger groups to complete the course assignment. In these cases, the student pairs or groups will typically complete an activity which creates an assess-able artifact such as a google form result, and often present their results (as a summative verbal discussion) to the other members of the class.

# Description of the Flipped-Class Spectrum
In the learning science literature, the “flipped-class” concept is one in which traditional lecture materials are provided to students in advance of an in-person class meeting such that the in-person class time can be spent undertaking a variety of so-called “active-learning” activities. This concept has been gaining traction as an innovative pedagogical approach which emphasizes students “doing” things rather than “listening” or “absorbing” things. In reality, before-class preparation has already been included in nearly all pedagogical approaches, where students have traditionally been expected to read materials from a textbook or other resource before coming to a class and learning materials on the same topic via a traditional lecture from an instructor at a podium utilizing slides or a chalk/whiteboard to walk students through course materials. In the flipped-class model, instructors have gone even further to include full lectures as part of the pre-class preparation students are intended to consume prior to attending the in-person course. These pre-class materials often include complete pre-recorded lectures such as what would traditionally have been given to students in the classroom. Students are expected to watch/review these materials ahead of the in-person class, thereby opening up time in the physical classroom to undertake activities which permit students to apply the materials under the guidance of the instructor, opening up new opportunities for instructors to engage in innovative active learning approaches which reinforce student learning. 

Within this research, we define the concept of a “flipped-class spectrum” representative of the degree to which any particular course is “flipped”. This concept attempts to categorize a course on a scale of zero to one to capture a completely traditional residential class with no flipped components (a value of zero) to completely online class where all components are flipped (a value of one), as well as any combinations thereof where some portions of the class materials are delivered as flipped content and others are delivered as residential content. The degree along this spectrum to which a course is classified therefore boils down to a ratio between the amount of a course’s content which is delivered in class (as in a traditional residential class setting) and the amount of the course’s content which is delivered as online resources to students ahead of the in-class session, which students are supposed to review ahead of class.
For demonstrative purposes of the categorization framework and to enable the evaluation proposed herein, the GEOG 215 course can be placed along the clipped-class spectrum as follows. First, all components of the class are enumerated as discrete components and are labeled with the applicable modes with which they can be delivered - either as flipped materials or as traditional residential materials. The course categorization based on the instructor and student activities for the GEOG 215 course is provided in the following table and demonstrates that the entirety of the GEOG 215 course experience can be operated in both the completely residential and completely flipped modes. However, in practical terms, a 50 minute class meeting time would not provide enough lecture time to complete all activities in-class - an instructor topical lecture, plus an instructor explanation of the student activity to be undertaken (individually or in a pair/group), plus the student or pairs/groups completing the activity. Therefore some components must either be skipped or offered in a flipped modality.

# Study Design
When the GEOG 215 course was first offered in Fall of 2018, each of the MWF sections were taught using a different mode. The Monday section received the full in-class lecture from the instructor, which was recorded. A very brief discussion of the activity was presented by the instructor and the class was asked to complete the activity on their own time as homework after their class period. The Wednesday class was asked to review the lecture from the Monday class ahead of their section as flipped materials. They were then delivered a more comprehensive set of activity instructions by the instructor in-class, which were recorded, and they were asked to complete the activity in-class. The Friday class was asked to review the lecture from the Monday class and the activity instructions from the Wednesday class as flipped materials ahead of their section, and then to spend the entirety of their in-class sessions working on the in-class activity. 

Using the spectrum classification described above, the GEOG 215 Monday class would be considered a zero, or a non-flipped course, very similar to a traditionally residential lecture-based class where all materials are presented in-class. The Wednesday class would be considered as a 0.5, or a partially-flipped course, with some components offered as flipped materials and others offered in-class with a focus on active learning rather than passive listening (to a lecture). The Friday class would be considered a one, or a completely flipped class, where all instructor-delivered materials (the topical lecture and the activity instructions) were offered ahead of the class period, and the entirety of the in-class time was spent by students undertaking the active learning activity.

With the completion of its first offering at the end of the 2018 Fall semester, the instructor had fully assembled all curricular materials for the GEOG 215 course in both traditional in-class lecture style, and as recordings sufficient for flipped materials. As such, this project seeks to formalize the multi-mode delivery, ranging from a zero to a one on the spectrum scale, of the GEOG 215 course in the 2019 Fall semester by offering the course in the same formats again, plus an additional completely online section (no physical in-class meetings). However, in its second offering the project team will rigorously evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each mode of delivery through surveys experiences and opinions of class members who choose to  participate in the study.

In these experiments, all students enrolled in the 2019 Fall semester of GEOG 215 will be invited to participate in the study. A graduate student associated with the project team, not the instructor of the class (the project investigator), will perform the enrollment and consent processes. The instructor of the course will not have any knowledge of which students choose to participate in the study, and participation and non-participation by students will have no impact on their grades. All students in all sections of the course regardless of their participation in the study will be provided an opportunity to take part in either their originally-assigned section (MWF), or to move to any other session as their schedule permits to take advantage of the different delivery modalities of the materials, including a completely-online virtual section where students consume all activities through the flipped modality and complete all activities online and are never required to come to an in-class meeting. Students may choose to move between MWF and online sessions at any time during the semester if they determine that one mode best suits them, but they are not in any way required to do so.

The opinions and experiences of students participating in this project will be captured through a series of surveys offered via email link to participants: (1) each week; (2) after the end of specific activities (individual and pair/group); and (3) at the conclusion of the course. These surveys will seek to enumerate and document the challenges faced by students pursuing different instructional modalities, as well as capture the positive experiences resulting from a student’s chosen interaction mode. Students will also be asked to consent to allowing the project team to analyze their graded course materials as part of the study.

This survey data will not be provided to the instructor during the course semester, as to ensure no impact on a student’s grade as a result of their non/participation in the study or their survey responses. Following the completion of the semester, i.e., after grades for each student are officially submitted such that study participation and survey responses cannot be used to affect a student, the project team will share the survey data with the instructor in order to evaluate links between chosen mode of instruction and student success in the course as measured by overall grade and the grades of specific assessments.

The data collected from participants documenting their experiences, opinions, and reflections will be analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, and signals in the pedagogical and philosophical construction and delivery of the teaching learning materials, and learner success across the flipped-class spectrum. All survey data from participants will be anonymized and used in research publications and presentations about key project findings.


# Course Options
The following four options are available to all students in the course. Students may choose to participate in any of the options, and may switch between options from week to week as their needs or preferences change.

## Option 1 - Mondays
The Monday sections of the course will most resemble a traditional lecture-style course. Students attending this session will participate in an instructor-led presentation and discussion of the course materials. The instructor will deliver a traditional in-person lecture covering the materials associated with the week's topics, and students will undertake their coursework, activities, and assignments outside of the classroom on their own time. 

Monday students will complete both the weekly individual and pair/team assignment/activities following the weekly in-class meeting (both as applicable, since there are not both types of assignments each week).

> Pre-Class: (1) Review lecture written materials; and/or (2) Do homework
>
> In-Class: (1) Participate in instructor-led lecture/discussion
>
> Post-Class: (1) Watch flipped activity description; (2) Do individual and/or pair/team assignment/activity

## Option 2 - Wednesdays
The Wednesday sections of the course will eliminate the traditional lecture-based component from the in-class experience, instead requiring students to review the pre-recorded lecture materials via online video ahead of the class section period (i.e., flipping the lecture component of the course materials). During the course period, the instructor will describe the in-class activity to the students, who will then work individually or in pairs/teams to complete the activity during the class period.

> Pre-Class: (1) Review lecture written materials; (2) Watch flipped lecture; and/or (3) Do homework
>
> In-Class: (1) Participate in instructor-led activity description; (2) Do individual and/or pair/team assignment/activity
>
> Post-Class: (1) Continue individual and/or pair/team assignment/activity (as needed if not completed in class)

## Option 3 - Fridays
The Friday sections of the course will eliminate both the traditional content-based lecture as well as the in-class activity description, instead focusing all of the in-class time on the individual and/or pair/team activity. Students in this section will be expected to review the flipped-lecture and the flipped-activity description prior to attending their class.

> Pre-Class: (1) Review lecture written materials; (2) Watch flipped lecture; (3) Watch flipped activity description; and/or (4) Do homework
>
> In-Class: (1) Do individual and/or pair/team assignment/activity
>
> Post-Class: None

## Option 4 - Virtual/Online
The Virtual/Online option will allow students to consume all course materials and complete all coursework completely online using the TAMU Learning Management System (LMS) BlackBoard. Students participating in this section will consume all instructor-delivered content by watching the flipped versions as online videos. Students will complete all individual and pair/group activities through online means with other online students. If there are no other online students, this option will be removed since it requires at least two students for pair/team activities.

> Pre-Class: (1) Review lecture written materials; (2) Watch flipped lecture; (3) Watch flipped activity description; (4) Do individual and/or pair/team assignment/activity; and/or (5) Do homework
>
> In-Class: None
>
> Post-Class: None
