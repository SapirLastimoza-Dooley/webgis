# ToDo
>
> In this assignment, you will reflect on what you have learned about the Geospatial Industry **since you handed in your last career plan**  to prepare an updated career plan. Since your last Career Plan assignment, you have learned more about communication, networking, writing, teamwork, and project management. As you have learned, each of these and other soft skills are used to a variety of degrees and intensities across different industries, jobs, and organizations.
>
> Your job is to update your career plan to account for any changed opinions as a result of what you learned in class from the insutructor, your peers, and any other people you may have discussed it with (your parents, for example), **plus** your new knowledge of which soft skills are empasized the most in specific mparts of the Geospatial Industry, and your personal preferences, abilities, and/or willingness to master these skills. Your arguments should support your plan.
>
> Your work should again include:
>
>1. At least one specific Geospatial **industry**, **organization**, and **job** that you could see yourself working pursuing. Your choices for choosing each should be supported by  your arguments in some way; for example, you could rationalize why you chose that industry/organization/job by comparing and contrasting your choices with alternatives that you chose not to select. 
>
> 2. A discussion of your choices to seek one or more Geospatial Industry-related graduate degrees (or a degree that complements your Geospatial undergraduate degree). You should take a side (grad school or not), and provide arguments that support your side. Be specific - does the Geospatial industry/organization/job that you have planned for require or not require grad degrees? Will you make more money in the long run by doing/not doing a grad degree? Can you get josb that are more exciting or fullfilling with or without a grad degree?
>
> 3. A discussion of your choices to pursue a Geospatial career in public vs private sector (or both, through time). For each of the immediate (after graduation), medium term (5 years after graduation), and long term (15 years after graduation) yo should indicate if you plan to pursue a career in the public or private sector, and argue why you have made these decisions. You may choose to stay in one or the other for your whole career to rise up the ranks, start in one and eventually go to another as life happens, or switch back and forth chasing money, but your should have reasoned arguments for your plans.
>
> 4. A discussion of how you plan to acheive your career goals. What activities will you pursue that will make you the most attractive candidate in the hiring pool to break into the Geospatial Industry and move upward? Do you plan to pursue internships or undergrad research, what networking opportunties will you seek out, how do your degree/track choices affect your future, and how will all of these and other factors  help you on your path to starting and being successful in your career? Where do you see potential pitfalls, and how are you mitigating potential consequences?
>
> With the addition of:
>
> 5. A discussion of how and why you think your soft skills match the particular career path you have chosen. It is perfectly fine to not excel at ac ritical soft skill **now**, and have a plan to get better at it in the future to support a career of your choosing. Also fine is to not choose an industry/job because you don't want to have to write scientific reports (academic work). You just have to argue how, why, and/or if your current/future soft skills match those needed for a particular field and mean that you will be able to excel in that field.
