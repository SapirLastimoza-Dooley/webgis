# GEOG 660 - Applications in GIS


## HW1 - Simple Basemap Use

**Title**: Simple Basemap Use

**Description**: Worked with ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Portal to create 2D and 3D scenes. Created output map with standard cartographic components.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Portal

**Data**: Various 2D and 3D data


## HW2 - Managing Vector & Raster Data

**Title**: Managing Vector & Raster Data

**Description**: Utilized data import, export, and conversion tools in ArcGIS pro to convert between raster and vector data types. Performed basic spatial analysis tasks in 2D and 3D, metadata management, data creation (from XY data), query definitions. and cartographic styling and symbolization.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro, GeoDatabases, Spatial Analysis tools, 3D Analysis tools

**Data**: Various 2D and 3D data


## HW3 - Symbology & Visualization of GIS Data

**Title**: Symbology & Visualization of Vector Data

**Description**: Performed mapping and cartographic processes in ArcGIS Pro to generate good-looking and functional maps for 2D and 3D data with attribute-based symbolization. Generated and included data-dependent legend, and performed data normalization tasks.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: 2D and 3D data of volcanic hazards, agriculture, and housing


## HW4 - Cartographic Components and Visual Hierarchies

**Title**: Cartographic Components and Visual Hierarchies

**Description**: Used ArcGIS Pro to create professional-quality map products/exhibits including necessary and relevant cartographic elements (title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, etc.). Utilized dynamic labeling approaches, various ArcGIS Pro views, and cartographic techniques to build an appealing and informative visual hierarchy.


**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: Various 2D data



## HW5 - Coordinate System & Projection Optimizations

**Title**: Coordinate System & Projection Optimizations

**Description**: Created and optimized the coordinate system and projection choices for map of various world regions, in order to satisfy specific requirements. Optimized layer and feature symbolization, created and included appropriate cartographic elements, and produced PNG output maps.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: Various 2D data


## HW6 - Geologic Feature Digitization

**Title**: Geologic Feature Digitization

**Description**: Used ArcGIS Pro to digitize several types of geologic features including karst features, faults, caves/sinks, springs, and outcrops from imagery. Developed and populated feature classes by creation of features through ArcGIS Pro editing capabilities. Optimized layer and feature symbolization, created and included appropriate cartographic elements, and produced PNG output maps.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: Travis & Hays Counties geologic imagery


## HW7 - Ethnographic, Population, Demographic, and Suitability Mapping & Analysis

**Title**: Ethnographic, Population, Demographic, and Suitability Mapping & Analysis

**Description**: Used ArcGIS Pro to compute and visualize data-driven trends across race, population, and place. Calculated comparisons between characteristics at multiple spatial scales (Congressional Districts, City, and National). Performed table cardinality analysis and design to support custom-developed attribute and data summarization/characterization queries. Performed site suitability analysis based on data characteristics. Optimized layer and feature symbolization, created and included appropriate cartographic elements, and produced PNG output maps.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: 2D demographic and administrative data sets


## HW8 - Spatial Analysis of Hazard Vulnerability - Austin, TX

**Title**: Spatial Analysis of Hazard Vulnerability - Austin, TX

**Description**: Used ArcGIS Pro to model and evaluate hazard (flood) risk to residents of Austin, TX. Performed table joins, buffering, clipping, polygon overlay, and geogrpahic union techniques. Developed expressions for to calculate field values based on attribute values and model parameters. Optimized layer and feature symbolization, created and included appropriate cartographic elements, and produced PNG output maps.


**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: 2D population, flood, and geophysical hazard-related data for Austin, TX


## HW9 - Retail Site Suitability Selection 

**Title**: Retail Site Suitability Selection 

**Description**: Used ArcGIS Pro to perform a site suitability selection process for a potential retail estabilshment in College Station, TX. Developed and used spatial and non-spatial (attribute-based) selection parameters to generate intermediate data layers for model input. Simulated and evaluated potential retail site locations. Optimized layer and feature symbolization, created and included appropriate cartographic elements, and produced PNG output maps.


**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Data**: 2D vector data of College Station, TX infratructure (roads, bike lanes, administrative units, etc.) and poulation/demographic data
