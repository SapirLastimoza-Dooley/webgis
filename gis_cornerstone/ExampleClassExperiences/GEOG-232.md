# GEOG 232 - Cartography & Visualization


## HW1 - Intro to WebGIS

**Title**: SEC University Web-Mapping

**Description**: Performed web-based visualization of SEC Universities using ArcGIS Online from zipped CSV file of geographic locations

**Tools**: ArcGIS Online, zip files, CSV data

**Data**: Zipped CSV file of geographic locations of SEC universities


## HW2 - Intro to ArcGIS Desktop

**Title**: Attribute-Based Population Symbology

**Description**: Visualized population data within ArcGIS using attribute-based selection and symbology. Performed spatial analysis and built table relationships to associate and filter attribute data/values across map layers

**Tools**: ArcMap, zip files, CSV data

**Data**: Zipped CSV (maybe?) of population counts per city (lst/lon)


## HW3 - Map Projections

**Title**: Map Projection Experimentation & Optimization

**Description**: Visualized the effects of projects on geographic features at different locations on the globe. Optimized projection selection based on various map factors.

**Tools**: ArcMap

**Data**: Zipped CSV (maybe?) of geographic points around the globe



## HW4 - Satellite Imagery Interpretation

**Title**: Satellite Imagery Interpretation

**Description**: Performed visual Interpretation of geographic patterns and processes from satellite imagery.

**Tools**: Google Earth

**Data**: Satellite imagery



## HW5 - Thematic Map Symbols

**Title**: Thematic Mapping of Hiking Trails

**Description**: Created production-quality symbolized map for printing from different geographic feature types (points, lines, and polygons). Created and styled map components (legend, scale bar, north arrow, etc.), and edited symbology (size, rotation, etc.) for optimal viewing.

**Tools**: ArcMap

**Data**: Zipped CSV (maybe?) of geographic features (points, lines, and polygons)


## HW6 - Typography

**Title**: Optimizing Typography of Built and Natural Features

**Description**: Performed basic cartographic tasks to symbolize built and natural features (highways, rivers) based on attribute data. Optimize the display and style of symbols and labels for readability.

**Tools**: ArcMap

**Data**: Shapefiles of geographic features (points, lines, and polygons)


## HW7 - Choropleth Maps

**Title**: Populations & Vital Statistics Distribution Mapping

**Description**: Computed descriptive statistics based on layer attributes. Classified and symbolized data based on attribute and computed statistical values derived from data fields. Created and optimized map components (scale bar, legend, north arrow, etc.).

**Tools**: ArcMap

**Data**: Shapefiles of geographic features (points, lines, and polygons)


## HW8 - Mapping Symbology

**Title**: Agricultural Land Distribution Symbolization

**Description**: Symbolized data using dot density, proportional, and graduated visualizations. Compared and contrasted different symbology approaches to optimize by data and map use types. Created and optimized map components (scale bar, legend, north arrow, etc.).

**Tools**: ArcMap

**Data**: Shapefiles of geographic features (points, lines, and polygons)
