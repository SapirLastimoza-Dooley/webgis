# Experience you have, but may not know you have

Many students think that they do not have anything relevant or interesting to write on their resumes. This is not the case. You can and should list the projects and homework assignments which you have done for your classes at TAMU.

To address this, we have created the following lists for several of the classes in the TAMU Department of Geography which definitely provide you with experiences that you can add to your resume. In each, all we did was describe in more technical detail what it was that you actually already did.

## Some ground rules
1. You should modify assignment titles and descriptions on your own personal resume so that you do not submit the exact same resume as someone else.
2. You must be prepared to discuss everything on your resume if asked by an employer, so make sure that you remember what all of these assignments are and what you did. (This is a good reason to keep a list in google drive or somewhere else with a description and your output map, code, or whatever was generated!)

## Some advice
1. You can and should pick and choose from these in order to tailor your resume to show the skills and experiences which are relevant to the job you are applying for. Plagiarizing your resume is an excellent way to not get a job.
2. If you have no other experience, you may want to list these as separate entries on your resume.
3. As you get more and more experience and classes under your belt, you will eventually run out of room to keep adding every assignment as an individual entry. So, you may want to start collapsing them as a bullet list under a single entry for the class.

## Other course?
If you are in (or have taken) additional classes that you would like us to add to this list, please just email us ([gis@tamu.edu](mailto:gis@tamu.edu?Subject=Class%20Experiences)) and let us know. We will ask you to send us the assignments from the class so we can generate similar lists specific to that class.

Good candidates include any classes you have taken in other Departments in the College of Geosciences, the Computer Science & Engineering Department, and anything else which is technical in nature - classes that use Matlab, R, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Databases, etc.
