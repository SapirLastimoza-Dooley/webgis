# Purpose
The purpose of this activity is to provide students with an opportunity to practice their research skills as they look for information about potential faculty within the Department of Geography for whom to do undergraduate research.

What types of skills is this preparing students for? 

> At the conclusion of this lesson, students should be able make the following "I can ... " statements in the context of a resume for a job application.

The specific goals of this assignment are the following:

1. For students to perform independent research to find a professor to do undergraduate research with.
    >
    > - Research  - "I can find the resumes, websites, and CVs of the faculty in the Department of Geography."
    >
    > - Critical Thinking  - "I can look at a faculty member's CV and determine what type of research they do."
    >
	> - Critical Thinking  - "I can look at a faculty member's CV and determine pieces of evidence that they do research with undergraduate students."
    >
    > - Critical Thinking  - "I can compare the the research a faculty member does with  my interests to choose a person that closely matches what I am interested in."
