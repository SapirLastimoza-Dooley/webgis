# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to provide students with an opportunity to practice their speaking and listening skills in the context of understanding the requirements for a GIS position and explaining to an interviewer how and why they are a good candidate for the position.

What types of skills is this preparing students for? 

> At the conclusion of this lesson, students should be able make the following "I can ... " statements in the context of a  potential employment interview, or in a meeting with a supervisor.

# Example 
Goldberg: GIS Programming Industry

>
> GIS programming is the best industry because:
>
>   1. **Indoors.** You never have to go outside. There are bees, snakes, and fire ants outside and I wear flip flops every day. Fire ants and flip flops do not mix. I like AC, as much tea as I can drink, and accessible bathrooms.
>
>   2. **Money.** GIS programming pays the most of all GIS jobs, no matter what industry you are in. I like a job where I can make lots of money.
>
>   3. **Engineering.** I really like the engineering piece of software engineering. Creating a whole project/product/system in my mind, then writing the code to build it is awesome, and I want to do that.
>
>   4. **Impact.** I like to work on things that will be used by other people. Nobody does GIS programming at a company on a system that won't be used. The impact of the work that I do is really easy to see - people using my systems or tools.
>
>   5. **Solitude + Team.** Programming doesn't go any faster when two people are working on a keyboard. I like to be able to sit by myself and do my own work. However, few systems are standalone, so at times you do have to meet with other people and groups to talk about how your work fits into larger systems. I also like being part of a team that are all working toward the same goal.
