### Pre-Class Activity
- Make them find a job ahead of time, research the company and industry, and be prepared to explain how they would fit in the company, how they are qualified for the job.
     - Critical thinking
     - Prepration

## Module 4 - Public vs Private

### Pre-Class
1. Each student will find an article describing a situation where lots of people lost their jobs after an organization went out of business or downsized (Enron).

2. Each student will find an article describing a situation where lots of people are getting hired in an organization (AECOM).
3. Provide one or more examples of anecdotal evidence of a positive news story about why your choice is better (Private: Esri is growing every year, Pubic: TRS is great retirement package)
4. Provide one or more examples of anecdotal evidence of a negative news story about why the other choice is wrong (Private: Enron, Pubic: EPA is getting slashed)

### Lecture Materials 
1. Go through all companies listed in the text and link to glass door website (Company + GIS) to show the jobs at that company. Should do this for all lectures.
2. Create list of all federal agencies and link to glass door website (agency + GIS) to show the jobs at that agency. 
3. Create list of largest for profit companies and link to glass door website (company + GIS) to show the jobs at that company.

- Add a [distribution of salaries from glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/gis-analyst-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm) for the 5 different types of jobs used in previous lectures.

- Add in a section about "Networking" - attending GIS day, events in houston, the PUG, Esri conference volunteer - that are extended interviews that they should attend.
- Letters
    - if they don't have any job experience, then it would be ok to get a letter from a person you have volunteered for talkig about your work ethic.
    - Letters, like their cover letter and resume, need to be tailored to the job. These would be better than
