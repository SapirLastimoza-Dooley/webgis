# Slides

1. 1 slide per minute
2. Animations are the devil
3. Always have contact info
4. every slide needs a picture (best slides have no words)
5. don't read your slides (slides should be a queue for the presenter not a script)
6. branding is important
7. presntations should be appealing to look at (use good colors schemes, no yellow)
8. Plan for the worst setup (poor resolution, no internet)


# Demo
1. Always pre-record (have locally)
2. Do not make any last minutes changes

# General
1. Good = confident, no stumbling, eye contact, not reading the slides, good time management
2. Slides should contribute to what you are saying, not replace it.
3. Mastery of the subject
4. To reduce anxieity: 
 a. Understand that most people don't care what you are talking about and are only in your talk becaue you happened to be there and they were required to be there
 b. realize that most people are not listening anyway
 c. do something to get people laughing - howdy trick, make fun of yourself
 d. have slides for the predicted questions after the end
