# Industries that use Geospatial Technologies

It is not an over-exaggeration to claim that nearly every industry that you can think of uses GIS. Think about it. You see maps for everything, everywhere. If you see a map, it means that GIS is involved. Other cases may be more subtle and less geo-obvious (made up word). Rest assured that GIS is still used, but it is in ways that are behind-the-scenes, or support the work done in an industry - they just don't have in-your-face apps that end users interact with.

## In-Your-Face Geospatial Uses (aka Apps, aka End-user side)

In many cases, it is plain as day that an industry is using geospatial technologies because there is an app. Ever wonder why your phone asks you for location permission when you install apps that should have nothing to do with mapping? A note-taking app, Instagram, a better calendar? All of these apps (seemingly nearly every app you install nowadays) asks for your location permission for one of a number of reasons. 

The first is the simple data vacuum approach - If there are data available, get it (the word data is plural, the singular is datum). Even if we don't have a reason for it now, get it anyway because we might think of one in the future.

Next, and more commonly is the "we can provide you with better services if we know where you are" approach. Sure this makes sense for Yelp, where they could not recommend you restaurants "around you" if they did not have access to your phone's GPS to know where you are. 

But why does a photo app or a note taking app need to know where you are? Sure, they might group your photos into set of "Places" to enable you to find photos faster by knowing where you took them. But in the note taking app case, it is less clear. What could they possibly be using your data for, or helping you with, that requires your location? Simply put, **marketing**. These organizations may be selling info about their users  such as geographic distribution, age, gender, interests, or other details to data brokers who eventually wind up using this information to target ads that you see to you, or people like you (same age, same gender, same general location, same general interests, same general behaviors, same general buying trends). 


## Behind-the-Scenes Geospatial Uses (aka Stuff you can't see, aka Research, Analysis, and Development)

In contrast to industries with flashy in-your-face apps you can see and use that highlight geospatial technologies, there are many industries and organizations that use GIS as part of their core mission, or to support their core mission, but for which there are no apps or maps that a regular user or citizen would see. 

Think about it. Does the CIA have an app that regular people can download and install? Definitely a "no". Does the CIA need to know where people, places, and things are? Definitely a "yes". This is just one example. There are many others. 

Have you downloaded a cancer risk app that uses your location in conjunction with layers about environmental pollutants to compute a score of how risky it is to live in an area based on a likelihood that you will get cancer? No, you probably have not. Why? firstly because real estate in areas with "high risk" would tank, homeowners would not be able to sell their homes, and tax funding would dramatically decrease for these locations. Lawsuits would pile up - "Dear mayor and city council, you knew from your maps that my children would get cancer if I moved into this region, and you still allowed me to buy this house? You now owe me millions of dollars because my kid is sick and you were negligent."

Even though there are few to no apps in this arena (due to the public panic they could create), there are still Medical Schools and Departments of Public Health, Community Health, and Epidemiology who are using spatial information behind-the-scenes to determine the causes of disease, promote healthy active living, and promote policies at the local, state, and national levels to decrease morbidity and mortality across the US population.

These two are extreme examples where GIS is used as a critical part of an industry behind the scenes, but members of the general public have no idea. It is safe to say that nearly **every** industry in America and across the world today uses spatial information in some way. 

"Spatial is special", "Everything happens somewhere", and Tobler's First Law of Geography - "Things that are closer in space are more related than things which are further away" - are now realities being leveraged by the most forward-thinking public and private organizations, driving the decisions that underlie modern commerce and governing. Companies not taking advantage of spatial data and relationships are having their lunch eaten by those that do. Hence the dramatic rise in companies and organizations that you would not have thought hiring Geography and GIST majors around the country.


# (A not complete set of) Geospatial Industries 


## Real Estate

**In-Your-face:** Obvious. You've been to a website to rent or purchase a house or apartment and you've seen a map with that shows house and apartments on it. With a simple google search you can find the retail locations for stores and services that you need to patronize.

**Behind the scenes:** How did that map get created? How did they collect or aggregate the data about those houses? How are these data being shown to you on your web browser (most likely on your phone)? How come when you click on a house/apartment you get details about? How do you think all that data is managed and delivered? How do you think prices are set? How do you think commercial organizations like Starbuck, Dollar Tree, Walmart all know where to put a store (site suitability selection)?

The answers to all of these questions involve spatial data, spatial data collection, storage, and management, and various geospatial technologies that operate on the internet (aka WebGIS) to deliver these maps and data to you and allow you to interact with them in a (hopefully) helpful way that allows you to get done what you wanted to get done - find a place to live.

## Defense & Intelligence

**In-Your-face:** For the general public - Very little to none. Why? Because if you can see the maps and data about intelligence assets, military plans, and exercises, so can those who would do us harm.

For members of the intelligence community and armed services - Tons. Do you think troops go into battle without maps? Do you think the leadership of the armed forces do not use geographic simulations to help keep our troops in the field safe? Did you not know that GPS was originally created for military purposes? Do you think the president does not see maps in his daily briefings? Did you not know that there was a place called the "Army Geospatial Center" which creates geographic data, software products, and geospatial analyses used to support the mission of the US Army? Did you not know that there was a three-letter US Agency with a seat at the same table as the CIA and NSA specifically for maps geospatial data - the National Geospatial Agency (NGA) whose sole purpose is to create geographically-based intelligence products to support the missions of the US intelligence community and armed services?

These are just the tip of the iceberg. For those interested in serving our country and working with the coolest data imaginable - we can only imagine because you will go to jail for the rest of your life if you ever tell anyone about what you do or work on - the defense and intelligence industries might be for you. Don't want to be a federal employee because you may not get paid well enough for your desired lifestyle? No problem, work for any of the tons of defense contractors and get the big bucks for doing the same job - Raytheon, Boeing (yeah, they do more than make planes), Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc., etc., etc. 

Want in? Get started today on your security clearance - meaning don't do drugs, don't get drunk all the time in public, don't have a gambling problem. The security clearance process does mean that someone from the government will interview all of your neighbors and roomates from every place you've ever lived, will look at your credit cards, will look at your social media, and will put you on a polygraph machine (depending on your clearance). This literally takes months and months and months so you will need to clean up your act, will need to gather contact data about everyone you've ever lived with or next to, and will need to apply early.

**Behind the scenes:** Too many to list. See above. You name any type of geographic data, service, hardware, or analysis technique and it is used for analysis, planning, or operations in the defense and intelligence industry. Satellite imagery - check (obvious - who do you think has the most satellites). Drones and drone data - check (obvious - who do you think invented them). Lidar - check. Geographically-linked social media data - check. Geographically linked open source data - check. GPS, radar, and other forms of positioning - check (obvious - who do you think invented them). Network analysis, raster processing, supercomputing - check, check, and check. The list goes on and on.

## Health & Wellness

**In-Your-face:** Most popular these days? Health and fitness tracking apps, definitely. Got yourself an Apple watch, a Garmin watch, or a FitBit? Like those fancy maps that show you the paths of your runs? Those are capturing, storing, and visualizing the GPS from your phone and/or watch during your run or workout on top of GIS data to help motivate you to lead a healthier lifestyle.

Other end-user maps and apps? Examples are endless. Seen any maps of diabetes, infant mortality, obesity, cancer, or other chronic or acute disease in the newspaper, on Fox News or CNN, or on the Public Health Department website for your city? Seen any Zika risk maps as you were planning your vacation to somewhere warm tropical, and beautiful? Seen a listing in the newspaper or local news website for the risk of UV, asthma, or pollen for the day or week?

Many of these end-user health maps and apps are geared toward informing the public of health risks so that they may prepare and/or undertake behaviors to limit their risk exposure and lead happier, healthier lives. Maps and other geospatial data tools and services provide a simple and understandable means by which health agencies and organizations can disseminate the results of their work to the broadest possible audience, thereby having the largest impact on improving public health.

**Behind the scenes:** Much of the behind-the-scenes geospatial health work is undertaken by researchers with degrees in the health field such. Often, those involved hold degrees like Masters of Public Health (MPH), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), PhDs, and PhD/MDs. The exact path to this work can be varied, including both the applied and research sides of an academic trajectory. The types of organizations that hire these people can be public (State and County Departments of Health, the US National Institutes of Health, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention), private (IBM, Microsoft, Google), or non-profit (The Gates Foundation). 

These organizations often have a research focus where they undertake specific kinds of work to explain the causes and spread of disease (epidemiology), determine the efficacy of treatments and interventions, quantify access and equity to health resources, or perform health surveillance to recognize the early stages of outbreaks and recommend or take actions to limit the number and severity of illnesses, deaths, or other disorders. This work is highly analytical, often involving the use of statistics to reveal patterns across space, time, and type of person or illness that can be acted on, either at the public policy or individual level to decrease the incidence of mortality and morbidity. Given the vast amount of information now collected and available about individuals and populations, data science, data management, and data visualization are also becoming more prevalent skills sought by employers.

## Logistics

**In-Your-face:** Obvious. When you go to the grocery store, is there fresh food on the shelves every time? How do you think that food got there? Somebody somewhere has created maps that allow raw ingredients to be transported to processing facilities to be turned into products, and those products transported to your local grocery store, while still remaining fresh and edible. 

Even more obvious, how do you think that UPS driver knew how to get to your house to deliver your Amazon packages within 24 hours, as you paid the extra shipping for? They, like everyone else, have a GPS in their vehicle that allows them to get to and from destinations on their delivery route in the most efficient manner possible. Been notified when a package has been delivered at your door? Boom. Geospatial technologies.

**Behind the scenes:** Possibly less so. Unless you have been employed as a delivery driver, a railroad conductor, are a member of a family of shipping magnates, or you own or work at an integrated oil company that moves products from beneath the surface of the earth, through pipelines, to refineries, to retail gas stations, you may not be aware of the vast amount of geospatial data and technologies that are involved in getting things to places on time. 

There are organizations that everyone has heard of - UPS, FedEx, DHL - whose entire business is planning the delivery of things to places on specific schedules. There are others you know but might not think of - American Airlines, United, Southwest - who move people (primarily) instead of iPhones, but still need to get thing to places on a schedule. There are others that are multi-billion dollar companies you may never have heard of - BNSF and CSX in the railway space, Maersk and CMA in the shipping space, and J.B Hunt and Schneider in the trucking space. Further still, there are organizations you definitely know, but might not think of such as the US Department of Defense - How do you think tens of thousands of service men and women, their vehicles, and their food and equipment get where they need to be, seemingly overnight?

Within each of these organizations, the same problem must be solved, albeit with different consequences for failure. How do we get these things (people, iPhones, oil, food, sneakers, bullets, medicine), to there (across the state, country, world), on time (within a matter of second, days, weeks), at the cheapest possible cost (saving fractions of a penny per unit might mean millions of dollars)? 

Transportation networks by their very nature are geographic networks, which means that geographic data are required and geographic analysis holds the right set of tools to produce the most optimal solution, evaluate and compare different options, and track and respond to network and supply chain disturbances that may affect delivery time or price. Professionals who work in this industry must have strong geospatial analysis, data management, and operational capabilities, are likely to encounter big data, and may be expected to utilize data science as part of their duties.

## Local Government

**In-Your-face:** Endless. Seen a map of the bus routes in your city? Happy when the police and fire departments can get to your house in under 60 second? Like riding on protected bike lanes or dedicated bike trails? Like that there are parks and playgrounds that are maintained and (sometimes) in the shade on hot days? Had the pleasure of hitting a "green wave" of traffic lights that gets you where you need to be without having to stop at a single red light? Happy that you (or your kids) didn't have to travel aimlessly around the city randomly picking up kids on the schoolbus? None of this happens by accident, and geospatial stuff supports it all.

All of these and many more are examples of the public-facing uses of geospatial data and technologies that local governments employ to serve the citizens of their communities. From the consumer perspective (aka the citizen side), you probably cannot tell that sophisticated geospatial data and techniques have been used to ensure that city services are delivered until something does not work properly and you think to yourself "Man.. These traffic lights are terrible. Can't they do some analysis to figure out the traffic patterns so that in the morning traffic flows better this [meaning my] way, and in the afternoon it's reversed"? Or, "There seem to be little to no protected bike lanes from here to there. What's up with that"? Or, "This street is horrible and is breaking my car. I wish I could report all these potholes to someone and track when they will be fixed." Or, "These voting locations could not be less convenient. Who put these here? Can't they do a better job"? For the property tax-paying public, other questions might be simply "How much did this particular house sell for last time it sold 5 years ago"? Or, "Which part of the city has the best schools"?

One of the best ways that local governments serve their citizens is by making the geographic data about their cities and the services they provide available at the fingertips of residents. Web maps, and the web services that provide access to data about city services are now extremely prevalent directly from city websites across the country. These maps, data, and services don't happen by themselves. They take effort across of many local government individuals, organizations, and departments, all working together, to create, maintain, and deliver these informational, planning, and tracking products to the citizens of their community.

**Behind the scenes:** The same geospatial data and technologies that provide end-users (citizens) with valuable services are typically employed (even more so) behind the scenes in local government planning and operations. Some local government organizations (obviously) use geographic data and tools more than others, and some simply could not function without them. 

Planning and zoning staff, for example, could not do their job without access to geographic data and modern GIS tools that allow them perform planning exercises to undertake "what if" scenarios of future growth strategies. "What if we rezone this gigantic grass field into mixed-use high-density housing with retail shopping? What would happen to the traffic flows and patterns getting into and out of the area? Is there enough capacity in the current school zones to accommodate another 250-plus families with 2.5 children a peice? How much will the tax base grow with the 15 new businesses we expect to show up. How much parking will be needed for these businesses?"

Beyond planning, other city, county, and local/regional government groups that utilize GIS on a daily basis include - everyone's favorite - the Tax Assessor who tracks property values and continually assigns updated values to real estate, the City Engineer who must plan and track things such as stormwater runoff to help prevent flooding, the School Board who must decide on school district boundaries based on changing population trends and new school construction, the County Clerk who must ensure equitable access to polling (voting) stations. At the regional scale, many Council of Governments (COGs) utilize GIS to collaboratively manage regional projects and initiatives such as planning for and responding to disasters, since hurricanes, fires, and floods do not obey city boundaries and effective planning, management, and response can be best served through a single regional approach rather than multiple, independent, and uncoordinated plans.

## Federal Government

**In-Your-face:** The most prevalent interaction that most normal citizens will have with federal geospatial data and technology comes in the form of tiny little letters at the bottom of online maps. These are the data sources used to power many of the most popular online web mapping systems such Google, Bing, and Esri maps. These letters include such terms as NOAA, NASA, USGS, EPA, NPS and all represent major data collection efforts that have been undertaken for decades by a variety of US federal agencies including the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), the US Geological Survey (USGS),  the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US National Park Service (NPS). These and other federal agencies have spent literally millions and sometimes billions of dollars collecting data about the Earth and other stellar bodies from the land, sea, air, and space in order to serve the short and long term needs of the US and global populations. 

These and other federal agencies are responsible for creating and maintaining other in-your-face geospatial tools, data, and systems, some of which we see everyday, others of which we hope we never see. In the first category are things we take for granted, such as our ability to pull up a map on any website and simply see the boundaries of states, counties, and cities. Without the official, digitally-based cartographic boundary files maintained by the US Census Bureau, there would be untold numbers of private and civil disputes about who owns what piece of land. Similarly ubiquitous data and services are offered by the constellation of federally-maintained GPS satellites that provide each and every one of us with the ability to know where we are, how to get from one place to another, and how and where to catch the best pokemon of the season. Without these and many many more federally maintained geospatial data sets and services, commerce and governing as we know it in the modern age would be impossible.

**Behind the scenes:** Under the hood, geospatial data and technology are utilized from the top to the bottom of the federal government. You think a single lawsuit filed against or on behalf of the federal government involving land, ecology, species and biodiversity, human or animal rights, trade, or a myriad of other topics does not have maps included? You think wrong.

From the most high profile survey of US residents - the US decadal Census - to the most boring of boring (for some) - investigating likely tax fraud, every single federal agency utilizes geographic data, tools, and analysis techniques to meet the goals of their missions to serve the citizens of the US. A simple 5 second search through the [Geospatial Section of Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/geospatial/) should convince even the most sceptic of critics that the [80% of all federal data is in fact geospatial data](https://www.google.com/search?q=80%25+of+federal+data+is+geographic), as reported many times in the popular press and the academic literature. With this much geographic data in the hands and at the disposal of the federal government, pick any agency and you will be able to drill down to a job that leverages geospatial in decision-making, practice, regulation, or research.

## Politics

**In-Your-face:** Some. Not a lot, but where there is sure is annoying. When money, power, and influence are involved, you can be assured that the smartest people and organizations will be using geospatial data and technology to get an edge over their political competition. As end-users, what most people experience would be the knocks on their front doors by political campaigns, or the robo-calls targeting them for information about a topic or candidate that seeks their attention, or even more likely asking for money. If you've ever wondered how and why you got targeted for a talking (or an ask for money) to by someone either in person or via phone or email, a map was used somewhere in the process to generate a likelihood score that a connection with you will sway your vote. These contacts are not free, and thus campaigns have to pick and choose who they contact, about what, undoubtedly choosing the lowest hanging fruit first to get the biggest bang for their political bucks.

**Behind the scenes:** Tons. Even the smallest of local campaigns are large undertakings for those involved. Soliciting volunteers and dollars, making campaign stops to shake hands and give speeches, and the plastering of road signs and front yards with advertising materials all take time, money, and people. The larger the stakes, the larger each of these must be become to succeed over one's competition. 

Since the advent of Gerrymandering oh so many years ago, it because obvious to those who wish to hold public office that geography matters, spatial data are among the highest value data, and spatial analysis techniques can give you a leg up on your competition. Modern campaigns utilize geospatial data and techniques to target communities with specific messages, ask for contributions, organize and coordinate volunteer recruitment and ground efforts, and of course, determine the needs, wants, and wishes of their constituents.

All three branches of the federal government utilize geospatial data in their political processes. From the Supreme Court, who often have to weigh in on illegal redistricting practices, to the House and Senate who must beat out the competition in their regions every few years to remain in office, to the White House itself where perhaps the most sophisticated use of geospatial data and techniques are brought to bear on elections, the geography of politics and the politics of geography really really really make a difference for those who know how to apply them for political gain.

Many other for, and non-profit, and lobbying organizations utilize the same tactics as politicians in order to spread their message, recruit members, and solicit dollars and volunteers with geospatial data and techniques. Did you really think the NRA or PETA don't use maps as they plan how, where, and when to stage protests, ask for money, or take other political actions?

## High Tech

**In-Your-face:** Tons. Google, Uber, Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Cisco, HP, IBM, Apple, Boeing, Amazon, and Electronic Arts. Name nearly any high tech company and geospatial data and technology run rampant through their business models or is the technology and/or data they sell themselves. From aerospace to ride sharing, from social networks to wireless networks, and from the self driving cars to car insurance, geographic data and service permeate our user experiences with literally hundreds of the high tech services, devices, and platforms we use every day. 

From the moment you activate your new iPhone, Apple knows where and who you are, leveraging these data to provide you with better maps, search experiences, and fraud protection. Make one single Google search and you will see ads tailor-made for your geographic location, your age, your gender, your interests, and your shopping habits. Calling an Uber? Geography confronts you from the moment you open the app. Looking for better car insurance rates? Install a driver monitoring app on your phone, drive like a normal person, and get better car insurance rates as a reward for allowing them to track your driving behavior through the spatiotemporal sensors on your phone. Need a USB-C cable within the next 24 hours while you are in a city away on travel or vacation? Get one for pennies delivered within 24 hours from Amazon through their global network of geographically distributed and spatially optimized supply chain warehouses.

The availability of high-resolution spatiotemporal geographic data (much of which is given away for free from the US government) has enabled countless high-tech startups and bohemeths to leverage location as a central part of their businesses and processes that have proven to be of great value to we consumers of these services.

**Behind the scenes:** You name it, people are doing it. Data, services, number crunching, analysis, visualization, supercomputing, artificial intelligence - Geospatial data powers or is powered by all of it. 

You say you want a constellation of shoebox size satellites circling the globe capturing imagery of every inch of the planet every 24 hours? Yup, that's a thing ([Planet.com](Planet.com)) and Aggies work there. You say you would like to access the real-time streaming data of the location of all cell phones in a region? Yup, that's been a thing forever (every cell phone company ever), and Aggies are doing it. You say you need a gigantic dataset containing pictures of the front door of nearly every house in America? Yup, that's been a thing forever as well, and although Google started it, lots of companies are doing it now, and guess what, Aggies work there too. You wish you could build full 3D GIS models of imaginary cities featured prominently as the backdrop in Disney movies? Yup, that's a thing (Zootopia), and Aggies work there doing that too. You want to take that imaginary 3D city from the animated movie and turn it into a battlefield simulation for gaming? Yup, and Aggies. You want to use that same tech that powered your game, with data for a real city, and build yourself a VR simulation for training members of the US Marine Corps? Yup, and Aggies again.

## Environmental

**In-Your-face:** Not too many direct in-your-face apps - though some, mostly for a "cause" of some kind - but your would notice if geospatial data and technology were not a thing in this industry. Care about the environment, even just a little? C'mon, even just enough that your deer lease keeps being productive, the lake you fish in has fish, or the beaches you enjoy are even still there? You a drill-baby-driller? You can thank geospatial for the fact that gasoline is not $100/gallon and its exploration, production, transport, refining, and sale are at all possible.

By some accounts, the main in-your-face outcomes of geospatial in the environmental industry are that we have an environment that we can enjoy at all. By others, the heat, air conditioning, and electricity that keep you comfortable, and the oil, gas, electric, or renewables that power your car, bus, or scooter to and from campus or work are the most important aspects of the environment that geospatial can help deliver, understand, and quantify. Most people probably hear about this the most as newspapers, online sources, and Fox News/CNN discuss lawsuits for or against a cause, the results of some kind of government action, or as plans are proposed for some kind of government or activist action, be it pro- or anti-environment, -hunting, -controlled burn, -pipeline, -endangered species, -development, -drilling, -habitat loss/preservation, -etc activity. You get the point. 

**Behind the scenes:** Tons, tons, and yet still tons more. Behind government work (defense and nondefense), the environmental industry is probably second in it's utilization of geospatial data and technology. Nearly every major development initiative nationwide requires an environmental impact assessment or report before it can be permitted, approved, or undertaken. Geographic research forms the basis for the arguments for and against environmental policies that eventually can become laws and regulations enacted to preserve, defend, and exploit the Earth's natural resources. Many passionate and talented people on both sides of these arguments could not develop (what they believe to be convincing) cases why something should or should not be allowed that will have an effect and modify, harm, restore, or otherwise impact the built and natural environments.

## Architecture, Engineering & Surveying

**In-Your-face:** Few, if any in-your-face apps, but tons of things that affect each of us if you think about out. Starting from the most basic - That house or apartment you live in is pretty sweet right? Imagine if there were no geospatial tools or data that could ensure that it was built in the right place so it doesn't flood every time it rains. Bridges are pretty awesome, right? Imagine if there were no technologies or data to ensure that the bridge connected from both sides so cars don't go tumbling down into the river when they hit it's apex. Property boundaries are pretty important, right? What if there were no data or technology existed to prove where one property ended and the next begins?

Getting a little more complicated - Imagine you are in a wheelchair. How do you think your navigation experience on the TAMU campus would be if there were no data to ensure that sidewalks can only be as steep as you can reasonably ascend? What if no stormwater control data could be collected or used to manage what happens to the rainwater every time it falls on campus? Does having to cross a raging river to get from Main Campus to West Campus sound fun to you? Would you feel comfortable climbing to your seats at the top of Kyle Field if you were not sure that the subsurface geological formations were known, understood, and the engineering process to build the stadium took the expansion and contraction of our terrible Texas clay into account?

More complicated yet - Let's say your organization is responsible for building a maintaining a natural gas pipeline that travels from Midland to Houston. You think this is possible to construct this monster without accurate geospatial information on changes in elevation, right of ways, and potential losses of habitat or human life and property should a catastrophic event occur? What if you are the local government responsible for responding to catastrophic events involving this or another pipeline? How far do you expect the damage to spread? How many people do you have to evacuate in the middle of the night?

The most complicated - Let's say you work at the Army Corps of Engineers and Harvey is bearing down on Houston. You have very tough decisions to make that will **definitely** result in loss of life if you make the wrong one - life and property hang in the balance. You need to be 100% sure that the geospatial information you have about levees, detention basins, hydrology, and hydrography in the region is correct before you decide to open or not open some of the dams in the region. You also need to be 100% sure that the simulations you have run for this very instance had the correct model parameters so reality matches science when you finally make the call to take some action.

In each of these instances, the availability and accuracy of geospatial data, models, and technologies can and will have an impact on the lives and property of ordinary everyday citizens. Though these citizens often can't see an app or website that demonstrates the in-your-face nature of geospatial in the architecture, engineering, and surveying worlds, it's there, it's important, and we would all be way way way worse off it were not available.

**Behind the scenes:** Tons. Entire departments in cities and at universities tons. While many civil engineers and architects would claim that their work is not and does not use geospatial data and technologies, they would be wrong (as would geologists and geophysicists who feel the same way). In all instances, these professional are working with geographic data (aka CAD, by them) in an information system (AutoCAD in many cases) that serves as a representation of the real world. Without linking engineered models and designed structures to the reality, no chance would exist to evaluate the consequences, suitability, or aesthetics of a particular engineering or building project.

Setting aside the GIS haters out there, most public engineering projects (local, state, and national), and private engineering and architectural firms have begun to embrace the power that geospatial data and tools can bring to their work. Geospatial data can now be integrated across most commonly used engineering and architectural platforms, with AutoDesk and Esri leading the way with their recently announced strategic partnership. The cross-fertilization of these data and tools is leading to advances in indoor wayfinding, automatic assessments of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, and sophisticated analysis and assessment techniques such as agent-based modeling and simulation for large-scale evacuation planning in public facilities.

## Emergency Management, Planning, Operations & Response

**In-Your-face:** Few, but very important. Most importantly, in the majority of locations, when you dial 911, emergency personnel show up to your location with a matter of seconds or minutes. If the geospatial data and services used by firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical services did not exist, you would know it because people you know would have died. Similarly, emergency notifications systems that play messages on the radio, scroll them across the bottom of TV screens, and pop them up on cell phones warning of impending flash floods and tornadoes could not operate with the geospatial data and technologies to target these messages to communities and individuals at the most risk. Specialized applications for college campus like Code Maroon also exist to provide timely and important information to targeted communities (members of the Aggie community) who are in the most danger.

During an emergency, geospatial data and technology are among the most useful and powerful tools in an emergency responder's toolkit. Hopefully most of us never have the chance to find out, but geospatial technologies for the backbone for much of the work done in emergency operations centers (EOCs), aircraft, terrestrial, and marine command and control centers, as well as the tracking of field personnel sent into harm's way to save the lives and property of ordinary citizens.

Prior to emergency events, there are many opportunities for the public to get involved and be informed about how to be prepared for and respond in emergency situations. City planning meetings are open to the public where geospatial data is utilized to help plan for catastrophic events, and city websites often contain useful geographic information that citizens can use to prepare themselves and their families for different types of life-threatening events. 

**Behind the scenes:** Emergency preparedness, response, and recovery are each academic and professional disciplines in their own rights, within which researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers often interact over maps and geographically-based simulations of events including worst case scenarios. Without mapping, and geographic data and analysis, it would be impossible to predict in advance where the most vulnerable communities are, and what the hazard exposure to these groups will realistically be under different hazard scenarios. This information is often used as the basis for putting remediation plans into effect to minimize the loss of life or property in a community. 

Changing perspective, crime mapping is a thing. Police departments all across the country use historical data about incidents of crime and attributes about a community or population to predict where crime will occur in the future, as well as create policing strategies to affect the levels of crime in specific areas. These strategies may include increasing the visible presence of law enforcement (increasing the number of officers on patrol in certain areas), increasing the amount of surveillance in an area (putting up more cameras), or affecting the physical environment to deter crime (putting up more street lights). All of these strategies are based on the spatiotemporal distribution of crime and factors in neighborhoods which may make them more susceptible to criminal behavior.

**In-Your-face:** Lots, growing every day. Ever downloaded the app or visited the map for a facility that you have visited? Yes you have, [AggieMap](https://aggiemap.tamu.edu) at least! Perhaps more commonly, the map for an airport? Even if you have never done this intentionally, if you have an airline frequent flyer number and have an airline's app installed on your phone, you already have maps of the biggest airport in your pocket. These maps of interiors and exteriors of large places are becoming more and more common every day as indoor positioning services based on bluetooth and wifi beacons become more accurate and ubiquitous within large facilities.

Nearly every college and university campus of any size in the country has a campus map at this point, with TAMU's [AggieMap](https://aggiemap.tamu.edu) being among the best, obviously. These campus maps are often provided as web pages users can visit, with some being integrated within standalone apps for the universities and colleges. Visitors make use of these maps to find the location of important buildings and academic services, get routing and parking directions to specific locations and events, and learn information about the campus around them. While most are still 2D interactive rendering of these campuses, some schools are pushing out full Lidar derived 3D versions, some with interior floor plans accessible to help plan one's route to and from a building and room they need to visit.

Airports, malls, and other large sporting and recreation venues often have web maps and apps that provide similar functionalities to campus maps, with the exception that systems for these venues are typically geared toward retail shopping, guiding visitors to places of interest where the retail shops and restaurants can separate the visitors from their money.

In all instances, geospatial data and technology provide the support on top of which these applications can be developed, launched, and used to provide visitors with important information about where to go to do specific things at a venue. Advanced features and specialized maps like those for persons with disabilities are popping up more and more every day.

**Behind the scenes:** Behind what visitors to a campus or facility see are the untold number of person hours required to collect, store, maintain, and disseminate these services for patrons. Campuses such as Texas A&M are larger than many other cities in Texas, and as such must employ a geospatial workforce comparable to that of a city to maintain the data and services which provide the core capabilities for providing campus mapping for visitors. Because of the diversity and heterogeneity of the operational infrastructure of a large campus, these staff often must be very nimble and include personnel capable of working with Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and data, Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and data, Asset Information Management Systems (AIMS), Transportation Systems, and Utility Systems.

Ever wonder how the internet works when it's raining, why the power stays on at school when it's off elsewhere in the city, or what the "steam tunnels" underneath the TAMU campus are for? You are not alone and many of these and other utility networks are stored as geospatial data and analyzed with geospatial technologies behind the curtain of the TAMU administration to keep the university operating, rain or shine 24x7, 365 days a year.

Yes, there are literally hundreds of miles of underground fiber optic cable criss-crossing the TAMU campus. Yes, there are ancient scary tunnels under the TAMU campus that once kept the building warm in the winter time. Yes there is more than one nuclear reactor on the TAMU campus. Yes TAMU runs its own power plant. Geospatial technology provides a unique set of tools for managing the infrastructure and utilities on campus which allows for planning, budgeting, simulation, emergency response, and day-to-day normal operations of our fair TAMU city.

## Oil, Gas, and Energy

**In-Your-face:** Some, not as many as you'd think. Ever drive a car powered by dinosaur bones? Boom.. The oil & gas geospatial industry at your service. Ever hear about this thing called "renewable energy"? Boom.. The renewable energy geospatial industry at your service. However, despite hearing about the many forms and sources of energy over and over and over again, the energy geospatial industry is surprisingly absent from most people's daily lives. Aside from seeing solar panels on roofs, and hearing the consistent twang about pro- and anti-NameYourFavoriteEnergySourceHere from Fox News/CNN/NPR/NameOfOrganizationThatTalksALot.com, there are remarkably little in-your-face apps about energy that consumers use on a daily basis.

**Behind the scenes:** Total opposite. Geospatial data and technology are hard at work all day, every day making money and saving the environment for those that know how to employ geographic smarts in the extraction of energy from this here planet, those there winds and waves, and that there sun. 

It was at one time profitable to randomly dig a hole in the ground here, there, and everywhere, and wait to see if if oil came bubbling out, but those days are long gone. Today's E&P companies (exploration and production), as well as those in midstream (pipelines) and downstream (refining and retail) all rely heavily on making better decisions than their competition to remain profitable. More and more commonly, these decisions are driven my intelligence fueled by geospatial data and technology. Where should we drill? Let's look at the map. Where should we buy our next lease (or sell)? Let's look at the map. Where are the underperforming wells owned by our competitors that we think we can turn into big producers? Let's look at the map. Where are we going to run this here pipeline? Let's look at the map. How are we going to get the tons and tons of trucks in and out of there? Let's look at the map. What path should this here helicopter take to deliver lunches to the offshore rigs? Let's look at the map. Harvey is coming, how do we make sure that all of our employees are safe? Let's look at the map. I think you get the idea.

However, in no other industry more so than oil & gas, will you find such a plethora of highly trained and successful scientists, engineers, and decision makers who will all swear up and down they don't do or use GIS, all of whom put geographic information into a system, they just happen to call it geologic or geophysical information, not geographic information. Sore point? No… Opportunity to leverage the might of geospatial technology to solve new and interesting problems, definitely.

And, on to renewables… Thinking of getting investors to build a solar farm out in middle of nowhere, near SunnyVille, SunnyAllTheTimeState? You better have a pretty good geospatial analysis up and running that evaluates the solar potential in your area across all days of the year, plus incorporates typical weather patterns if you want to not be laughed out of the room. Now that you have this data in hand, have you estimated the market potential in the area as well as the ability of the existing grid to absorb your power on clear days while your site is producing? No, better get your GIS out and do some GIS'ing if you want to be taken seriously.

Maybe wind is more your style. Onshore, offshore, whatever, both sound like good ways to make some bucks and save the planet. Now, you just have to tackle all that same market, utilization, and storage capacity analysis as solar, but you also have to worry about birds and whales. That's right, wind farms are a gigantic killer of birds. More than you would think. Even more than those that get evaporated at solar farms by ultra-hot beams of light. Lets go water then.. Turns out the subsea sound from wind turbines on the ocean has largely unknown, but probably not great, effects on the largest mammals on the planet.

Fine already, lets go clean and tidy nuclear. Oh wait, yeah.

Despite these and many other challenges, the traditional (oil & gas, nuclear) and renewable energy markets are all chugging away, with geospatial data and technologies at the heart of the companies at the forefront in each sector. Those with the best geographic data will win, and may help lead us on the path to energy sustainability.

## Finance

**In-Your-face:** Not much, unless you work for a finance company or bank, or have lots of money. When most people think of finance, they think of banks. Obviously, you can open up your banking app on your phone and find the locations of retail locations to hit up an ATM. But, this industry is one of the biggest users of geographic information and geospatial technology around. Don't believe this, just search for GIS + Finance on a job site, and you will be amazed.

**Behind the scenes:** A surprisingly lot lot. What's the number one rule of finance? Make money. Who makes money? Those with the best information. What kind of information is very valuable? Geographic information. Starting to connect the dots? What kind of work goes into geospatial financial analysis? All kinds, let's have a look.

Ever wonder why stores ask for your ZIP code when you make a purchase? Ever wonder why grocery stores and pharmacies make you sign up for their "club" so you can get better prices? Ever wonder why you get a Bed Bath and Beyond card in the mail, moments after you move to a new place to live? Old school geotargeting (aka pre-Google targeting), that's why. These companies and organizations realized long ago that understanding where their patrons come from can provide you them with important demographic information about who you are, what you are likely to buy, and what "value" you represent to the company. By tracking your location, your purchasing habits, and characteristics about the type of person you are, these companies can tailor the ads you see, the modes by which you receive these ads (online, via mail, etc.), and the special incentives that they use to lure you into their brick and mortar or online stores to spend your money.

You know whose money is actually spent to put new business ventures onto the market? Banks, that who. You know what banks don't like to do? Lose money. Any idea how banks assess their risk of losing money in a new venture (a storefront, a merger or acquisition of an oil company, the launch of a new offshore oil rig, the mortgage for a single family home)? Geospatial analysis. That's right. In all of these cases, geographic information can play a key role that allows those with money to estimate their risks of making enough money to be worth the trouble of participating in the deal.

## Insurance

**In-Your-face:** Based on the number of commercials you are forced to watch, a lot. Geospatial data and tracking can provide you with cheaper car insurance rates if you let companies track information from your phone about your driving behaviors. 

**Behind the scenes:** Even more. First, there are car insurance rate, which are set by the risk profile in an area. Ever wonder how and why car insurance rates vary by ZIP code? Because the risk profile (as computed through geospatial techniques) varies along with the people and number and severity of incidents in ZIP codes. Then there are flood insurance rates. These are set by the proximity of an insured property to 50, 100, 500, and 1000 year flood plains, aka out of date maps that no longer are capable of predicting where flooding will occur for any given storm. 

Then there are these things called reinsurance companies. These are the insurance companies for the insurance companies. These guys are really really big use geospatial technologies because they have to track, model, and price the impact of natural and manmade disasters on all kinds of industries since they will be left holding the bag when an insurance company has to call its insurance company for help. A tsunami hits Taiwan? What will that do to the price of hard drives and who is going to make an insurance claim when companies start not being able to get them to put into computers and retailers start suing for non-delivery of contracted items? Flooding wipes out the out the soy crops in middle America? What will that do to cattle prices and who is going to make an insurance claim when contracts for cattle feed cannot be fulfilled? "Cows gotta eat, and we had a deal. Pay up for breaking the contract." 

Do you like dreaming up the worst things that could possibly happen, and then thinking through what the impacts would be? Do you want the word "catastrophe" in your job title? These reinsurance companies study and predict the impacts of all kinds of doomsday scenarios, because if any one of them were to occur, they better have built it into their pricing models or they will go belly up. None of this can be accomplished without extremely detailed and complex geospatial analysis based past, present, and future human and natural systems.

## Entertainment

**End-user side:** Tons. You like animated movies? Zootopia, anyone? Yeah, one of those guys is an Aggie who used geospatial data and technology at Disney to make the imaginary worlds that power blockbuster animated movies. You like video games? Yup, can't be done without geospatial data and technology. You like all those zoom in from space, satellite images, infrared mapped high-tech scenes in movies? While fake, still cool, and still can't be done without geospatial technologies and data (and a healthy serving of Adobe). 

**Behind the scenes:** You wanna work on a project that has a $200 million dollar budget? No kidding, who wouldn't? Go work in Hollywood on the next blockbuster summertime action flick with imaginary worlds that has to be built, revised, built again, revised again, etc. etc. etc. until the director and producers are happy that it is perfect and cannot possibly be any better. You seen the hundreds of names in the credits of big money films? Some of these people are geospatial people, just like you.
