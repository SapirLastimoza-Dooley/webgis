# Navigating Job Types and Descriptions

There are no rules that require companies to list a job with a specific title to do a specific set of things. As you are searching for jobs, you will surely see this. Many jobs with different titles do the exact same thing; many jobs with the same title do something completely different.

This will be a super-frustrating part of your job search process, but there is, unfortunately, nothing you can do about it. Companies are free to name a job whatever they like, and they are free to put whatever qualifications and responsibilities into any job they like as well. You just have to be diligent, use appropriate search terms, and look through lots and lots of job ads until you find the one that you are looking for, or for which you are best suited.

There are some _common_ job titles which you would think have the same duties and qualifications across all companies and industries, but you would be wrong. As you investigate, you will see that every job is a tiny bit to a lot bit different, even though it has the same title. Within a single company, these are usually pretty consistent, but across companies, not really.

Anyway, we will now try to make sense of this mess by categorizing some of the most common job titles, and summarizing what they _typically_ mean. This will by no means be a complete list, and will likely not be accurate for any specific job that you will find, but it's as good a start as possible. We will list all jobs as "GIS somethingorother", but you can substitute "Geospatial" and  "Spatial" for "GIS" in each.

1. GIS Analyst
2. GIS Technician
3. GIS Specialist
4. GIS Developer
5. GIS Administrator


# Job Titles

There are some very common job titles that you will see all the time, which are pretty commonly encountered across the industry. Then, there are some special ones that companies like Esri and other software companies use. In the following, each job title is categorized as Un/Common, and a general discussion of duties and qualifications is presented.

Again, note that there are no rules in job titles, duties, or qualifications. A GIS Analyst at one company may do the exact same job as a GIS Technician at another. Further, a GIS Specialist job at a company may include all the duties from both GIS Analyst and GIS Technician. 

Each job ad that you see must be taken as a unique instance that you should analyze to see if you are a good fit. No two will the same, except in some instances of the same job at the same company. Even here, you will be working on different projects, teams, or for different supervisors, so differences will not be uncommon.

## GIS Analyst

**Commonality:** Extremely. The GIS Analyst position is the most common position in industry. This position is available in every industry. 

**Duties:** With the word "analysis" in the title, you should expect this job to involve some sort of thinking, using GIS as the technology that provides the data upon which you think. Often, people with this job will be provided a bunch of data, a problem, and the instructions "solve that problem", or "give me the information that I need to make a decision". You will be expected to work with GIS data, software, and technology in order to created and maintain information (spatial data), but  you may also be asked to link spatial data with lots of other non-spatial (aspatial) data, because that might be where the information lives, and it needs to be put onto a map for a decision to be reached. You will definitely make maps, be expected to communicate information with people above and below you, and have to be able to think critically about a problem, your data, what they are and are not telling you, and potentially, what the best route to an answer to a question or a solution to a problem would be. You may be required to perform statistical analysis to show that your results are meaningful, to prove a fact in a court of law of for a municipal filing, or to provide evidence that your data support the answer to the question you are looking at.

**Qualifications:** You definitely must have experience making maps and managing spatial data. Evidence that you have solved some kind of problem or answered some kind of question using GIS as your toolset will be required as well. Soft skills related to critical thinking and communication will be seen in many job ads.

**How to demonstrate you are qualified:** Maintaining a portfolio of cartographic outputs along with a brief description of what question you were trying to solve, a list of the technology you used, and some bullet points of the decisions you had to make about your technical approach or data, the specific steps you took to solve the problem, and the approach you took to make sure that your answers were correct, would be something that you could show to employer in an interview in order to spark a conversation about "why was that an important problem", "why did you use that data or tool", "how did GIS allow you to answer that question", or "How were you sure that you answered the question"? These are all things that would demonstrate your ability to do analysis, from the beginning - framing a problem as on that GIS can provide a solution for; through planning - what are the steps you need to take to answer the question; through execution - do you have the technical skills to get the job done; through communication - can you communicate a technical problem and solution to others.

**Types of candidates:** This job involves critical thinking and the ability to be handed a problem and told "get me the answer" using the tools and data at your disposal. If you can work independently, think your way through a problem from start to finish, and like to work with, look at, and slice and dice data, this might be a good job for you.


## GIS Technician

**Commonality:** Extremely. The GIS Technician position is a very common position in industry. This position is available in every industry. 

**Duties:** With the word "technician" in the title, you should expect this job to involve some sort of systems (databases, servers, computers), and a lot of software. It would not be too much of a stretch to consider this the "IT Gal/Guy" of the GIS industry. You do GIS, for sure, but you also must be IT and Tech-savvy. You can expect this position to be a little more "technical" than an analyst position. What does technical mean? More map making, more data management, more data collection, more interacting with servers and databases, more use of hardware and software overall, and probably some programming to automate the tasks that no one wants to do. These positions are often the ones that gather, organize, and crunch the data in order to provide them to someone else who will do the interpretation and analysis (though you will likely be required to do some of this as well). You may be asked to configure servers and databases so that other people can connect and use them. You may be asked to write python scripts to increase the efficiency of GIS operations, because computers are good at running GIS stuff overnight, people are more cost effectively used to do the thinking. You might be asked to make web maps for displaying GIS data to people without needing to use ArcGIS on their desktop. You might be asked to configure and deploy cloud-based GIS apps like ArcGIS online and  ArcCollector, or you might be asked to setup ArcGIS Enterprise in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and move all the data from local (on-premise) storage to AWS ArcGIS Portal instance.

**Qualifications:** You definitely must have experience making maps and managing spatial data. In addition you must have technical skills that you can demonstrate. What could these include? Things like data organization and management, programming or scripting, server administration, use of cloud services like ArcGIS online, field equipment like GPS, and additional software and cloud systems outside of ArcGIS like AWS and Microsoft Azure. 

**How to demonstrate you are qualified:** Same as analyst, except you need to highlight the technical skills that you have. In your project write ups, make sure to include in great detail the technical systems, software, and data processing that was required to accomplish your goals. Include an analysis of the different types of technologies that were available, and some bullet points of why you chose the tools, data, or systems that you did to solve your problem. Maintaining a github repository that employers can see which includes all the code you have ever written would be an strong additional selling point of your technical abilities. Creating an ArcGIS online account that employers can see where you store all of your data (in an impressively organized manner) along with web mapping outputs, your ArcGIS collector apps, and other ArcGIS fancy applications would be a very strong demonstration that you can keep up with the latest Esri technology, can learn it fast, and can use it to solve important problems. 

**Types of candidates:** This job involves technical stuff. Sure, there will be a healthy amount of mapping and analysis (GIS people are often Jack's/Jill's of all Trades, so expect to have to do a broad spectrum of things), but the key word is technical. If you building computers, setting up servers, working with the latest technology, and are really good at organizing data, this might be the job for you. If you wish someone else would handle all of the errors that you see using Esri products, and do not want to spend the time to try to work through errors or other technical implementation approaches, this is probably not for you.


## GIS Specialist

**Commonality:** Fairly. The GIS Specialist position is a common in some industries, not in others. 

**Duties:** This one can be confusing. As a "specialist", you may be the only GIS person on a team with other people, where you do all the GIS for whatever it is that they are working on, **OR** you may be specialized into one very narrow type of GIS job where you are supposed to be the expert on that thing. On a team of engineers building a bridge? You may be the one that goes and gets the GPS coordinates, processes the data, and makes the maps they present to the city - basically all of the GIS that they need, start to finish. On a team of wildlife biologists? You may be the one that processes the data coming in from radio trackers, cleans it, makes maps, and does the analysis to figure out where poaching is occuring with spatial statistics. You will definitely be required to make maps and manage data, but you might also be required to perform advanced GIS spatio-temporal analytics or do technical work like setup ArcCollector or GeoEvent processor. This job title is very very specific to the organization that is doing the hiring, so generalizing is quite difficult.

**Qualifications:** Combine Analyst and Technician and you might be getting close. 

**How to demonstrate you are qualified:** Same as above, but you should show that you can specialize in something. How to do? Work on one project for a while. What kind of project? Doesn't matter, unless there is a specific industry that you are seeking to get into. Choose whatever you are passionate about. Do a good job at it, and show that you are now an expert in that thing. Create multiple versions that build on top of each and get more and more complex to show that you can refine a project as you get better at it or learn or gather more information. You will need to be able to talk through the whole thing, start to finish - "This project was important because …", "What I was trying to accomplish was …", "The approach I took was …", "From that point I learned … so I …". Plus, all the technical stuff that you did, why you did it that way, etc.

**Types of candidates:** Difficult to say, depends on job. If you turn out to the goto GIS person who supports a team, you had better be a person who can handle responsibility and pressure, and deliver on time with good work. Your whole team will be relying on you, so it will be stressful, and you had better be able to do the work needed to not hold up the rest of your team. If you turn out to be a very specialized analyst on a specialized group solving a specialized thing, you should at least have an interest in that thing, or you will hate going to work every day.


## GIS Programmer

**Commonality:** Extremely. The GIS Programmer is very common. It is found across all industries. 

**Duties:** Simple. Programming. Kidding aside, there are lots of different types of things that a "GIS Programmer" might be expected to do, from web, to server, to high performance computing (HPC), to desktop, to mobile, to databases - there are needs and opportunities for GIS programming in all of these. Other duties might include the configuration, setup, or maintenance of software systems on servers (locally or in the cloud), desktops, and mobile devices. Hopefully evident is that you think of a type of programming or system engineering, there is a GIS Programmer doing it somewhere for some company. Included in these jobs are, in addition to others, requirements gathering - what is it that a system needs to do; prototyping - developing small, quick, cheap implementations to confirm with the customer or user what it is you are supposed to be building; development - doing the actual coding of the real system; testing - confirming that the system does what it is supposed to do, gives the right answer, gives and answer quick enough; maintenance - fixing bugs as they are discovered through testing or by end-users; configuration management - keeping track of the code, test cases, and development environment so people can do development work; and project management - budgeting the time and effort for the development lifecycle, managing development and testing, ensuring that systems are developed on time. Popular languages that you might need these days to use include Python, Javascript, C# & .Net, Java, Swift & Objective C, VB, PHP, SQL, R, and a host of existing and newly emerging languages. C and C++ are used as well, but these are not typical end-user languages (i.e., languages that you would utilize to make use of existing systems, packages, and APIs from Esri, Leaflet, Mapbox, etc.). Instead, you would be using these languages to build out the guts of the ArcGIS platform from a job inside Esri, or within core and backend systems at Apple or Google.

**Qualifications:** Simple. Demonstrated ability to do programming. More specifically, you will need to be competent in one or more common programming languages, such that you can be given a task and know how to do it. No two companies will have the same development approach or environment, but you should have enough experience in a language (hopefully the language that you are being hired for) so that you can hit the ground running. Typically, this means that you will have had more than one semester of training in a language. Preferably, you will have undertaken some large project in the language already that you can point to as an example of your abilities in that language. It is helpful if you know how the internet works, since almost all systems will be pulling or pushing data to/from some internet source.

 

**How to demonstrate you are qualified:** Start a Github repository and put all of your code in there. But wait, "Won't that be giving away all my valuable source code"? No, your code you develop as an undergrad is likely not valuable. You will definitely be better off in the long run by getting  a job because a potential employer can see real examples of your work. It's even better if they can download and run your system. From these artifacts, an employer can see that you code like a normal person, use comments, and structure your systems in ways that other people would - because you did it the right way. For web programming, you should start putting up apps and maps inside of the ArcGIS Portal for TAMU, or the main Esri public portal - same reason. Companies will be able to see that you can develop maps and apps, that you know how to use industry standard tools, and that you can organize your system so that it actually does what it is supposed to do.

Take one of the TAMU GIS Programming classes. All of these classes are accessible to you now, for free. You can sign up for a semester course, or just go through the material on your own and play around:

- [GEOG 352 - Spatial Databases - SQL](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-659-Spatial-Databases/Residential)
- [GEOG 476 - GIS Programming - Python](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-676-GIS-Programming/Residential)
- [GEOG 478 - WebGIS - Javascript/Servers](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-678-WebGIS/Residential)
- [GEOG 489 - MobileGIS - Mobile Phones](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-695-MobileGIS/TAMU-GEOG-695-MobileGIS-)

**Types of candidates:** People who like programming, or are interested in programming. If you took a Python or Java class and hated it, this is not the career for you. If you are a tech person, maybe, but you have to be interested in how stuff works under the hood. If you just want to use high-tech stuff and not get into the nuts and bolts of it, think about any of the other GIS jobs instead.


## GIS Administrator

**Commonality:** Sparse. The GIS Administrator is not super common. It is found across all industries. 

**Duties:** What does it mean to "Administer" GIS? Good question - it can mean a lot of things. Typically, this person will work in a large organization with lots of other people doing GIS, and their job is to perform all the behind-the-scenes magic that allows other people to do their job. This entails a significant amount of data management - making sure that data are backed up, accessible to those (and only those) who are supposed to be able to see them, that multiple people can work on data and that the versions do not conflict, and that these data are discoverable (through metadata creation and maintenance), and meet the performance expectations of users (meaning they are fast). This position is probably also in charge of the GIS servers for the organization (setup, configuration, maintenance, and monitoring) as well as the end products that use the data from the databases, through the GIS servers. These may include web maps, mobile apps, and desktop ArcGIS users. This person is also likely in charge of any cloud-based GIS services for the organization, including the ArcGIS Online Portal for the organization. Other duties likely include managing users, groups, permissions, and access controls to ensure that only the people who are supposed to be able to access or modify things are the ones who can. People in this job probably write scripts to automate time consuming tasks, schedule things to run overnight, and otherwise automate jobs to free up the (expensive) brain time of actual staff for other more important tasks.

**Qualifications:** You had better have worked with ArcServer, SQL Server, and ArcGIS Online before. You should have a pretty solid background on (Windows) server-based stuff - how websites work, how and why data are stored in databases, what a Windows Active Directory is, and how to move things in and out of AWS or Microsoft Azure. You should have the ability to write scripts to automate tedious tasks, to transform data from one source or format to another, and to schedule things to run on a daily basis. A background with hardware will be helpful, at least so you can talk intelligently when people ask you for the specs for a server you want them to buy for you. 

 

**How to demonstrate you are qualified:** Challenging because you probably do not own servers that you run out of your house for hosting GIS data. There are still some things that you can do. The Amazon Educate program will provide you with $100 free dollars per year of processing AWS time, which is a fair amount for you to play around with. Also, the Esri Developer Program (of which TAMU is a member) will provide you with free access to all of Esri's server systems. With these two, you can practice setting up your own little mini company to build services, maps, and apps to demonstrate that you understand how all of this technology fits together. In addition, any time you have to do a tedious GIS task twice, write a script for it so you never have to do it again. Put this script inside of your GitHub account and share it with the world. Again -  \
"What about all my intellectual property"? Again again, it is not as valuable as you think. You are better off with evidence that you can do the work in a job interview than you are banking on the 20 line script that move files between folders to make you a million dollars.

Play around with the free server resources that you didn't know you had access to:

- [Amazon Web Services - Free Cloud Computing/Servers](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)
- [Esri Developers Program - Free GIS Software + Your Own ArcGIS Online](https://developers.arcgis.com/)

**Types of candidates:** People who see other people wasting time and get annoyed. People who just want to say "Just do it like this and it will be better, I swear." People who like to be in charge, aka the Lord of the Data. If you can not stand watching someone do something the wrong way (because you know your way is better), this is your chance to build "the right way" and make other people use it, because you are the "Administrator". If you like building better ways to do things, or have a "system" for everything - putting the dishes in the dishwasher, folding sheets, etc. - this might be for you. You will be in charge of the GIS infrastructure (data, code, sometimes people) and you may be given the authority to make people do it the way you think it should be done. Other perks include being able to tell people "No" if you have a good reason, since you get to make the decision (since you know the best).


# Be Critical of Job Ads

If a job seems too easy, too hard, is not described in any detail or too much detail, you should be wary. 

[This page has a good discussion of what to watch out for](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-spot-toxic-software-jobs-from-their-descriptions-c53cf224417f). It's for development jobs but the concepts still apply.
