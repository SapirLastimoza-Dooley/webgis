# Class Review

## Activities
 1. Pre: class Job searching activities works
 2. In: 
   1. Good: getting to know other students
   2. Bad: Hard to find someone after class when the time runs out in class
   3. Option: Reduce the number and group a few together (after all the job searching stuff, etc.)

## Homeworks

### Writing
1. Creating resume was useful since some have never made a resume before
2. Learning to write a cover letter was useful and planning to submit them now
3. Career plan - good to see what kind of jobs you need to get in order to get the job you want

### Speaking
1. Speaking into phones was "all right", "neccessary", no one can think of a better way.

## Most Useful Parts of the semster
1. Retirement calculator
2. Showing the job sites (glass door, etc.)
3. Tables of links to specific types of jobs
4. Being able to write github on a resume is useful (but getting it to work locally is real hard)
5. How to go about pursuing research (the process of how to start)
  1. Having to research a professor was interesting


# Lectures

## 2 - Industries
1. More industries and jobs than people realized
2. Differences between salaries was interesting

## 3 - Types of jobs
1. The links to example jobs were useful because you could see the types of jobs, and type of places they are in
2. Could be incorporated into the prior one

## 4 - Public vs private
1. Different types within categories (gov: defences/non-defence, private: non/profit; publicly traded/privately owned)
2. Pro's of defense (get clearance, get double salary in industry)
3. Could be incorporated into the prior one (possibly change the order to: do public/private, then the industries, then the jobs)

## 5 - Interview process
1. Useful for people who have never interviewed before
2. Maybe combine the first half (job descriptions, etc.) into a prior lecture
3. The forms were new info that people didn't know
4. Negotiating - knowing what to do with multiple offers, and how/what to negotiate for is helpful.

## 6 - Resume & cover letter
1. Most valuable is to use the words from the job description
2. Creating the "adult words" version of the labs from classes was useful

## 7 - Value of Internships + Research
1. Learned that you can get credits for these
2. Steps to take to get hooked up with research/professor was good 
3. Freshman have a hard time looking for internships becaue they have not taken any GIS classes and have no GIS experience
 - Maybe come up with and add advice for these people to get internship experience (work for a professor over the summer)
4. Potentially cut/reduce other HILEs

## 8 - Grad school
1. Useful but a little too detailed
2. Most ueful is that grad school should be paid for by someone else
3. Combine with internships/reserach

## 9 - Career Planning
1. Retirement calculator was the most valuable (what to do to get/stay on track)
2. Planning backwards (from last job to current job) was a good way to think
3. Finding a role model allows you to break down the steps for success "rather than fantasizing"
4. Move tables of awards to an additional resources page - link to it from the main homepage/readme (add a new table, also include the industry/job links there as well)

## 10 - Professonal/scientific writing
1. The email part is good (accentuate this one)
2. The rest people have heard since middle school (make an outline, etc. - should be shrunk down a bit - remove but add to the additional resources section)
3. Realization that being an OK writing is good enough releaves a little stress

## 11 - Networking
1. Business cards part was useful
2. Conference stuff was useful - Since people there are always looking to hire

## 12 - Public Speaking
1. Slide basics are good
2. Laundry list of bad presentation styles is useful to help avoid them
3. Howdy trick is cool
4. Combine with networking
5. Remove but add to the additional resources section - redundant becasuse every student has to take another C class anyway.
