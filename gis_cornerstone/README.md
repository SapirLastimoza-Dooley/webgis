>**Course Lecture Options:** Students should plan to  participate in the weekly section that they are enrolled in (Monday, Wednesday, or Friday). However, being a pandemic and all, we realize that students may have things going on in their lives which prevent them from attending one or more of their weekly registered sections throughout the semester. In such cases, students should participate in a different weekly section during weeks that they are not able to attend their normal section. All students will complete the same coursework and be graded using the same scales. All lectures from each week will be made available as recordings for students who cannot attend a session and wish to review materials after the fact.

Please refer to [Student Rule 7](https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor” [(Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1)](https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/).

“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence” [(Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2)](https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/).

Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. [(See Student Rule 24.)](https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/)

## Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”

“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” [(Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20)](https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules).

## COVID-19 Details, Guidance, and Precautions
The Faculty Senate temporarily added the following statements to the minimum syllabus requirements in Fall 2020 as part of the university’s COVID-19 response.

## Campus Safety Measures
To promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, Texas A&M University has adopted policies and practices for the Fall 2020 academic term to limit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to and between classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.):

- Self-monitoring: Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. **Students who have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class remotely and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.**
- Face Coverings: [Face coverings](https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf) (cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spaces including classrooms, teaching laboratories, common spaces such as lobbies and hallways, public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaces where 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coverings and additional guidance are provided in the [Face Covering policy](https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf) and [Frequently Asked Questions](https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs) (FAQ) available on the [Provost website](https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs).
- Physical Distancing: Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors, and others in course and course-related activities.
- Classroom Ingress/Egress: Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exiting classrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms promptly after course activities have concluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 6-foot physical distancing when waiting to enter classrooms and other instructional spaces.
- To attend a face-to-face class, students must wear a face covering (or a face shield if they have an exemption letter). If a student refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor should ask the student to leave and join the class remotely. If the student does not leave the class, the faculty member should report that student to the [Student Conduct office](https://studentlife.tamu.edu/sco/face-covering-violations/) for sanctions. Additionally, the faculty member may choose to teach that day’s class remotely for all students.

## Personal Illness and Quarantine
Students required to quarantine must participate in courses and course-related activities remotely and **must not attend face-to-face course activities.** Students should notify their instructors of the quarantine requirement. Students under quarantine are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they have symptoms that are too severe to participate in course activities.

Students experiencing personal injury or Illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualify for an excused absence (See Student Rule 7, Section 7.2.2.) To receive an excused absence, students must comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in Student Rule 7. While Student Rule 7, Section 7.3.2.1, indicates a medical confirmation note from the student’s medical provider is preferred, **for Fall 2020 only, students may use the Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class form in lieu of a medical confirmation. Students must submit the Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class within two business days after the last date of absence.**
