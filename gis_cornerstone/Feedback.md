Intro to industry - good examples, more than they would have thought
 - People didn't know that they could work in lots of different industries beyond just oil & gas
 - Not enough time to get through all the industries
    - Separate the job sites from the industries into two lecturs

Types of jobs - Explanation of jobs was useful, google doesn't tell you what the difference is
 - All the jobs are the same, so good to know that.
 - Good information

Public/private - Liked it
 - Liked seeing the pros/cons laid out for each one.

Job getting - Liked it
 - 

Resumes - Liked
 - Add: different industries have different resume requirements
 - Most helpful - use the keywords from the job ads - new people didn't know that
 - Most useful - forced them to creat one. Was around the right time (Geoscience career fair). Learned that the way that they were doing it was wrong (included irrelevant information).
 - Cover letters - super useful, did not know to make one before. good instruction. 

Internships - liked
 - Useful because it gave them a plan for getting the foot in the door, and this is how you have to do it if you want to get the job you want.

Graduate school - liked
 - Possibly remove/shrink. Most people don't want to go to grad school so not super useful.
 - Didn't change anyone's minds but did help them understand how to get in if they decide to go - not just grade based.

Career planning - did not like because it was frightening
 - Eye opening
 - "Bummed me out"
 - Good to look from the end goal, and work back - helping them plan
 - Possible awards and scholarships was useful - they didn't know they existed before. Add to the geography dept website.

Writing
 - it was kind of ok. Just repeated everythign that they have already been told before.

Networking
 - Purpose being Establishing life conections was important advice.
 - Previously thought that networking was a "thing" (abstract idea) that was not understood. Now they have concrete examples that they can acutally do.
 

What went well
 - General intro to industry that I had no idea about previouslu.
 - Possibly useful info
 - Creating a Resumes
 - Creating a cover letter
 - Understanding of the Types of jobs was usful for a person trying to get jobs.
 - Learning that grad school could and should be paid for - amde them not not want to go anymore.
 - Making teams, then arguing in front of the class
 - Course as webpages
 - Their resumes are a lot stronger
 - All the assignments were beneficial to "us as a person" instead of other class' labs which don't seem relevant
 - An actual class where I want to keep the information.
 - Take this one because it's useful to you early in your academic career
 - This the "how to get a job" class
 - It was pretty low stress
 - It was organized


What didn't go well
 - Too many topics for class
 - Github (setup on their own computer) - will be learned in other classes
 - Hard to find assignments because the navigation is too deep
 - Including dates on the table's assignments (don't just use weeks because no one knows what week it is)


What could be better
 - Speaking in front of class - Break them into groups and they talk to each other.
 - They wish the class were longer - Possibly make it two credits
 - M class did not have discussion - they wish they did
 - W/F only got dicsussion: don't wish they got a lecture
 -- They felt like they actually learned stuff by talking to a neighbor
 - Combine week 7 + 8 (internships + career planning)
 - Combine 2 + 4 (industry + public private)
 - Combine (Job getting + resume)
 - Git hub was good learn, but not used enough to be actually good at it - mostly just a pain in the ass - remove.
 -- We use google docs and drive for everything anyway
 - Pre-class - make them available earlier
 -- Easy to complete, easy to work through (google forms was not terrible)
 -- It forced them to look over the material in advance - they would look at it and continue reading because it was mildy humeroius
 -- Ungraded: good. 
 -- Took just a few minutes to complete
 -- Did get them prepared to talk about stuff in class, "got them in the mindset"
 -- Navigation sucked.
 - in-class forms
 -- Helpful as summarization of the topic
 -- Forced people to start a discussion of the topic
 -- 
 - Landing page for the course: kinda of like what blackboard shows - what's due this week.
 - Make upload form for uploading resumes
 - Add STAR into the interviewing session. Maybe make it an in class activity.
 
 
 Flipped
  - Read ahead of time: almost 100% of the class
  - Videos: A few people did a few times
  - 

Things which were missed
 - STAR
 - Certifications in GIS

TODO:
- Send out resume reviews to everyone.
