# Steps To Complete Assignment
## Create TAMU GitHub account
TAMU hosts a cloud-based Git repository like GitHub or GitLabs free for use by students, faculty, and staff. The TAMU GitHub is great as it lets its users have access to what would otherwise be paid features on the actual GitHub, such as individual private repositories, organizations, organization seats, etc. To create a TAMU GitHub account, go to [github.tamu.edu](https://github.tamu.edu/) and use your NetID to gain access. Before you go hog wild please take five minutes to give the [FAQ](https://github.tamu.edu/pages/tamugithub/changelog/) a quick read. Be sure to email your TA your username once you've created your GitHub account so they can add you to the class's organization. 
>
## Create a repo for this class
When you have your account created and go to the TAMU GitHub main webpage, you should see a box on the right side like this:
>
![My repos](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/githubmain.png)
>
This is where all your repositories will be listed along with any forks of other repositories. You can also create a new repository in this box as well. The red arrow pointing to the lock indicates that this particular repository is private: it is only visible by people who have been invited to collaborate on it. The blue arrow shows the repository's name, in this case **GISPROGRAMMING**. The longer part between the two arrows is the organization name or TAMU-GEOG-676 in this example. Organizations are like people in that they too can have public or private repositories, but are comprised of a whole group of people. An example of this could be the TAMU-GEOG-676 organization with members Stacey Lyle, Dan Goldberg, Aaron Harmon, Xiao Li, and Zhengcong Yin. We're all team members of TAMU-GEOG-676. This can be broken down further by having teams inside of an organization. This all makes much more sense in a business setting where you would have teams like marketing, developers, testers, management, etc. These teams would have access to team specific repositories owned by the organization. 
>
![Create-a-repo](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/gitcreaterepo.png)
>
Now then, click the **New repository** button. This goes to the **Create a new repository** page. You'll see the typical info needed. In this instance you'll see that daniel-goldberg is the owner of this repository, but if you're part of an organization or many, you'll be presented with a drop down of these. This is how you would create a new repository under an organization. When naming repositories, you should give them short-yet-descriptive names. Don't make it long winded like "Billy Joe's GEOG676 Class Work". That's too many words and waaaay to many spaces. Don't use spaces at all for names in computing, be it your repository's name or on your computer. Just don't do it unless you like headaches. Descriptions are mainly for describing what your project is about if your name happens to make no sense whatsoever like this little fella [here](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe). Below that you have your security settings public or private. Public makes your repository visible to **EVERYONE** on TAMU's GitHub. The option **Initialize this repository with a README** is *kinda* useful. This will create a file inside your repository called README.md, .md standing for Markdown. Markdown is how all these fancy lectures and labs are written. If you're familiar with LaTeX it's a little bit like that. For us though think of the README.md as a homepage for our repository. Inside the README would go all the detailed information regarding the entire repository. The red arrow is for adding a .gitignore file, we'll touch on that later. For now leave it on **None**.

>
>
> You should name your repo **GEOG-215**
>
>

>
Here you'll create a new repository and give it a meaningful name such as **GEOG-215**; make sure to mark it **private** and check the box **Initialize this repository with a README**. Press create and you should be presented with this page here:
>
![First repo](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/gitcreaterepo-edit.png)
>
This is the first thing you'll see whenever you click on a repository. This page will list basic information such as owner, description of the repository, and general popularity (the watch, star, and fork in the top right corner). If you note the red circles in the image above you'll see all are related by commit. Whenever you commit and leave a message it can be read here. When you create the repository on GitHub it will make the files, stage them, then commit on your behalf with the commit message "Initial commit". The bottom red circle in the middle is referring to the most recent commit that affected README.md file; since it was created in that commit it reads "initial commit". The top blue circle shows the files that are currently inside the repository. Since we just created this and only have a single file README.md, that is what is shown. When you have many directories and files they'll all be listed here as well. The bottom blue circle is showing the contents of the newly created README.md. Whenever you initialize a new repository with a README, it will just throw the repo's name into it as shown. 
>

## Create folders and pages for class assignments
Once you have your repo created, you can now add folders, files, and documents. For this assignment, you should create the following structure - a homework folder, with a folder for each assignment (01 - 08), each containing a readme.md file:

> \homeworks\01\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\01\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\02\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\03\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\04\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\05\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\06\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\07\readme.md
>
> \homeworks\08\readme.md
>

## Edit your repository's main readme.md
Within your repo, click on README.md, then click on the edit button. Enter your information:
> 1. Personal Information section
>       1. Name
>       2. Email
>       3. Section
> 2. A table with links to your homework
>
You can use this [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help you write better looking Markdown files. Now that you have all that you can commit your changes and push them to your repository. 

> 
Make sure to add a README.md to each homework\0X\ folder inside the labs and homework directories. This can be a simple README.md with your name written on the top for now. Do not forget to stage, commit, and push these folders. When you're all set and done make sure to submit your information and your repo's TAMU GitHub URL into the [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asgZ-OjwHw-AMKJIOee2W1RajMpPAJJ9RdfWB9L3dvM/edit#gid=0) for this assignment.


# Optional Tasks
If you are interested in getting some experience using GitHub from your local computer (like you would do if you had a job), feel free to try your hand at getting GitHub setup and running on your computer. This part is optional.

## Download and install Software

### Git
We will be using github for all materials in this class. This is a valuable skill that you will be able to add to your resume. You will be writing your assignments in something called **Markdown**, which you will hate at first, but learn to love. Luckily you can export from Word directly to markdown. 
>
Your first step is to [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (**Mac users**: see note below), making sure to select the options that allow you to have "Git Bash Here" in the Windows context menu. Usually, the default options are the ones you want to go with when you do a software install; you can always change them later if you need to.

NOTE: For Mac users, the git installation process is a little different. Open the terminal app (use command+spacebar and type "terminal" and hit enter, or navigate to the utilities folder within the applications folder in Finder and launch it from there). In the terminal window, type `git --version` and hit enter. A window will open and prompt you to install some software, follow the prompts to install git.

### Git Extensions
A useful tool to make using Git a little easier is called [Git Extensions](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions). This will add some useful tools like a GUI (graphic user interface) based merge conflict tool and most importantly it will add a right-click context menu for Git commands. If you have a Git repository visible inside of File Explorer you can right click it to get a series of useful Git commands to perform on such repository. I personally use this to pull repositories quickly without having to type `git pull origin master` for each repository.
>
![Git Extension](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/gitextension.png)
>
For this assignment, you should [download and install Git Extensions](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/). When installing, click yes to everything so all features get installed. This is already installed on the Teague lab machines if you planned to work there. You should **really really** install this on your personal computer or laptop so you don't ever have to go down to the labs. (**Mac users**: Sourcetree or GitHub Desktop are good alternatives to Git Extensions, Google those names for more info)
>

### Visual Studio Code
We strongly recommend that you download and install Visual Studio Code to perform your editing/writing. It integrates perfectly wityh github, and will save you a lot of trouble versus the alternative - editing with notepad or something similar. This is already installed on the Teague lab machines if you planned to work there. You should **really really** install this on your personal computer or laptop so you don't ever have to go down to the labs.
>
For this assignment, you should [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). When installing, click yes to everything so all features get installed.

## Create a local clone of your repo 
To start adding files we'll need to **clone** the repository you created to your local computer. As of right now the repository only exists wherever TAMU GitHub saves stuff. On the main page for your repository you'll see a green button labeled **Clone or download**, click it. You should now see a popup like this: 
>
![Clone menu](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/gitclone.png)
>
You *could* download your repository using the **Download ZIP** but I will always advise against it. When you download the zip you're not downloading a git repository, you're downloading the repository's files which is **NOT** what we want. Back to cloning. Click the little clipboard button to copy your repository's unique URL (it should look like https://github.tamu.edu/daniel-goldberg/GEOG-215.git, note the .git part). Now at this point I'm assuming you have Git installed on your computer. 

### Cloning from GitHub to your computer
>
The following is the terminal command you need to run to clone your Github repo to your computer.
>
> `git clone https://github.tamu.edu/studentusername/nameofrepo.git`
>

1. Create a directory path like so `C:\Users\myName\Classes`. (Mac: `/Users/myName/Classes`)
2a. Get to a command prompt in that directory (**Mac users**: see 2b.)
    1. Use windows command prompt
        1. Open up a terminal / command prompt and navigate to `C:\Users\myName\Classes` with `cd C:\Users\myName\Classes`. Your command prompt is now within the Classes directory. To clone from GitHub or any other provider, use this command with your own repository URL you copied earlier:
    2. Use the right click menu of windows explorer
        > 1. Open windows explorer
        > 2. Go to the directory you created
        > 3. Right click
        > 4. Click on "Open git bash here"
        >
        ![Clone menu](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/GitBash.png)
        >
        > 5. Type the git clone command into the bash window
        >
        ![Clone menu](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/GitBashClone.png)
        >
2b. **Mac users**: Get a terminal window in that directory (*use the same spacing and capitalization as shown*)
    1. Open a terminal window: press the command key + spacebar, type "terminal", and press enter
    2. Use the `mkdir` command to create the `Classes` folder for us: type `mkdir -p ~/Classes` and press enter
    3. Open the `Classes` folder: type `cd ~/Classes` and press enter
    4. Clone the repo using the `git clone` command listed above (with the `https://github.com/studentusername...` swapped out for the link you copied in the last section
    5. *For the rest of the instructions, any references to a "bash window" or "command prompt" mean the terminal window on Macs*

Git will go and clone your repository from TAMU GitHub. Once it's done downloading, there should be a directory inside of `C:\Users\myName\Classes` (Mac: `/Users/myName/Classes`) with the name of your repo; for our example that name would be **GEOG-215**. High five you've just cloned a Git repository. 
>
You can now edit create and edit files and folders directly on your computer, then **commit** and **push** them up to Github to synch between your computer and the cloud hosted version of TAMU Github.

## Commit your changes 
In order for changes you make locally to get up to the github server, you have to (1) commit them, and (2) push them to the server

### Method 1 - using the terminal
>
If you still have bash window open, you can move into the repo folder and commit and push your files using the command line. 
>
Make sure your terminal / command prompt is currently in your repository directory and use this command to stage and commit your changes:
>
`git add *`
>
`git commit -m 'Edited the main README.md'`
>

Now you have snapshot'd your changes and Git has made note of it. Now you can push your commit(s) to your TAMU GitHub repo. Wherever you push your commits is known in the Git world as a `remote`. Go ahead and `git push origin master` to push your changes to the server. Your repository *may* not use the names `origin master` but 99% of the time it defaults to `origin master`. Now to finish this part of the lab go ahead and add folders to your repository with the structure found inside the main class README.md. You should a similar structure in your local repository:
>

### Method 2 - using Git Extensions
If you prefer to not use the command line, you can use windows explorer to check your files in via the right-click context menu in the folder with your repo.

> 1. Right click in the folder, choose git commit.
>
![Right click commit](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/GitCommit1.png)
>   
> 2. Stage all of your changed files (stuff in the top left panel) by clicking on the multi-down arrow.
>
![Stage all](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/GitCommit2.png)
> 
> 3. Add a comment in the commit message box and click the commit and push button.
>
![Commit & push](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/GitCommit3.png)
> 

### Method 3 - using Visual Studio Code
If you prefer to not use the command line, or Git Extensions, you can check your files in directly from visual studio.

>
The following screenshot shows what your repo should look like (in VS Code).
![Example repo structure](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/images/modules/01/finishrepo.png)

> 1. Click on the GitHub icon on the top left of VSCode (weird looking thing, 3rd icon down - should have a number on it if you have files that are changed)
>   1. Your changed files will be shown on the bottom list.
>   2. Enter a commit message in the text box.
>   3. Click the check mark above the text box.
