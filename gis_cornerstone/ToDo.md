# Week 1
1. Update week 1 lecture to include details of the individual assignments (to be completed ahead of class), and partner/team (to be completed in or after class)

# Each week lecture
1. Include more details of the individual and team activities on the actual lecture page so students do not need to click so deeply.

# Assignment vs Activity links
1. Update the links in the text of the assignments which require writing something to github to be 
    1. HW0X/readme.md for homeworks
    2. Activity0X/readme.md for activities
2. Update resume bank to be a google form, not a spreadsheet
3. Combine the two google forms for Homework 08
    1. Link to video
    2. How did the team work
    
# Week 10
1. For the email section, add in that you should not send emails which simply complain, since they do not provide eveidence that would change a person's mind, nor an alternative plan that you would prefer. Add in some examples of good/bad which demonstrate this - I get assigned to teach MTWThF 8:00AM + 6:00PM - what would a bad email to Dave be, what would a better email to Dave be (and why).
    
# Standardize Activity description pages
Make all of the activity pages the same with all the content on one single activity page rather than as sub folders/pages for pre/in-class.
1. Medium example: [Act04](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/blob/master/activities/04.md)
    1. Has activity details on lander but is missing due dates/times (like in the separated ones)
2. Bad example: [Act06](https://github.tamu.edu/TAMU-GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/GEOG-215-GeospatialCornerstone/tree/master/activities/06)
    1. Person has to click from lecture, to activity landing, to each activity (pre/in).
